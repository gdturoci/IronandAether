        <h2>Letting Creativity Flow</h2>
        <h3><p>There are a great, great many monsters and creatures presented in this book that
         players are free to use and place into their campaigns as they wish. But what if you 
         have an idea for a monster that isn’t presented here? The solution to this is simple:
         just make a stat block for it yourself! Presented here is a step-by-step method of 
         creating your own creatures in manner akin to those presented here.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 0: Modify an Existing Creature</h2>
        <h3><p>Before dedicating the time and energy necessary to making a creature of your own,
         try to find an existing creature already in this book that is similar to the one you 
         have an idea for, and modify it (in lore, mechanics, or both) to suit your idea. This 
         may prove more fruitful than you think!</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 1: What is its Name?</h2>
        <h3><p>Every great monster needs a name. Think of a name that properly captures the 
         beast’s essence, its gravitas, the terror (or otherwise) that it should strike in all 
         those that hear it.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 2: What Type of Creature is It?</h2>
        <h3><p>Is this creature a <a href="./Monstrosities.html" target="_blank">Monstrosity</a>,
         <a href="./Beasts.html" target="_blank">Beast</a>, <a href="./Undead.html" target="_blank">Undead</a>, an <a href="./Others.html" target="_blank">Other</a>,
         or something else entirely? Knowing what type of creature your monster is is important 
         to knowing its niche in the world and under what circumstances your players can/should 
         encounter it.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 3: How Big is It?</h2>
        <h3><p>A creature’s size is important for a multitude of factors. A creature’s size will
         inform you of its Health, its defenses, how much damage it should deal, and the scale of
         its threat.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 4: What are its Ability Scores?</h2>
        <h3><p>A creature’s ability scores convey a great deal of information about it, primarily
         what it is good at and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Additionally, its ability
         scores will inform its defenses and saves. The highest any creature’s ability scores can
         go is 20, though there are exceptions for creatures such as gods and Titans.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 5: How Good are its Defenses?</h2>
        <h3><p>The next step is determining the creature’s DEF/RaDEF scores and its saves: 
         assuming it is wearing Light, Medium, or no Armor, its Dodge score is determined by its
         size + its DEX modifier + its AGI modifier and cannot go below 0.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Armor is a bit more difficult, and requires some arbitration, but with
         a solid baseline: a creature’s Armor is dependent on the strength and toughness of its 
         hide and scales, if it has any, as well as its size; it can also wear actual physical 
         armor, increasing its Armor score even more.  Use the following table as a guide.<br>
        <b>Creature Armor</b>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><b>Drops...</b></th>

            </tr>
        </table>
        &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Its <a href="../Rulebook/Part1/Chapter6.html" target="_blank">saves</a> are determined by its ability score modifiers: Fortitude is 
         its STR modifier + CON modifier divided by 2, rounded up, minimum 1; Reflex is a
         creature’s AGI modifier + DEX modifier divided by 2, rounded up, minimum 1; Willpower
         is comprised of the modifiers of any 2 of the 3 mental scores (INT, WIS, and CHA)
         divided by 2, rounded up, minimum 1.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 6: How Much Health Does it Have?</h2>
        <h3><p>Much like its Armor score, a creature’s Health is also informed (at least in part)
         by its size: refer to the following table as a guide.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><b>Size</b></th>
                <th><b>Health Die (Average)</b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tiny</td>
                <td>d2 (1.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Small</td>
                <td>d4 (2.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>d6 (3.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Big</td>
                <td>d8 (4.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Large</td>
                <td>d10 (5.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Huge</td>
                <td>d12 (6.5)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Massive and Colossal</td>
                <td>d20 (10.5)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;As for determining exactly how much Health a creature has, that is up
         to you to decide, and is ultimately a big factor in how difficult you want the monster 
         to be/how long you want the fight to be, i.e. monsters with more Health will be more
         difficult and make for longer fights. If your creature ends up having an odd amount of
         Health Dice, round its average Health down, so a creature with 3d8 Health should have 13
         average Health; also, don’t forget to multiply its CON modifier by the number of Health
         Dice used and add that to its average Health, e.g. a creature with a CON score of 4 (2)
         and 5 Health Dice will have 10 (2 times 5) added to its average Health. If you want to
         vary a creature’s Health without rolling all of its Health Dice, consider rolling a 
         single Health Die and adding or subtracting that to its average Health depending on 
         whether the result is odd or even, respectively.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 7: What is it Vulnerable/Resistant/Immune To?</h2>
        <h3><p>Depending on a creature’s nature, it may be vulnerable, resistant, or immune to 
         certain damage types or conditions, e.g. Scorched will be immune to burn damage but
         vulnerable to freeze damage, and snakes cannot be knocked prone.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;If a creature is vulnerable or resistant to any conditions, then it has
         disadvantage or advantage respectively on saves against those conditions.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 8: How Fast is It?</h2>
        <h3><p>A creature’s speed is largely determined by its size, but is also modified by its
         AGI score and general body shape: for example, Tiny creatures are able to cover a lot 
         less ground than Large ones, and quadrupeds are much quicker than bipeds. If a creature
         is a quadruped, add 10 feet to its walking speed; aside from that, refer to the 
         following table for determining a creature’s walking speed – remember a creature’s Base
         Movement refers to its speed when its AGI score is 4 (2) - 5 (2). Your creature may also
         be an exception to this rule, such as with the Quickling.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th><b>Size</b></th>
                <th><b>Base Movement</b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tiny</td>
                <td>15 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Small</td>
                <td>25 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>30 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Big</td>
                <td>35 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Large</td>
                <td>40 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Huge</td>
                <td>45 feet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Massive and Colossal</td>
                <td>50 feet</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Also remember that a creature may be more at home in the water or in 
         the air than on land, in which case the above table applies to their swimming/flying 
         speed rather than their walking speed.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 9: What Skills Does it Have?</h2>
        <h3><p>This step is rather straightforward: whatever you believe your creature is good at,
         give it the appropriate proficiency in the appropriate skill, e.g. a land-based creature
         that is good at swimming should have a Swim proficiency of <u>></u> 3.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 10: Does it Have any Special Senses?</h2>
        <h3><p>Some creatures, particularly nocturnal ones or those that have lived in the dark
         for extended periods of time, will develop special senses to help them survive in their
         environment, or they may have these senses as a result of arcane influence: senses like
         infrared vision, blindsense, or something else entirely.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 11: What Language(s) Does it Speak?</h2>
        <h3><p>Many creatures and monsters are able to speak, either physically or telepathically.
         If your creature can speak, consider what languages it does know, or if other creatures
         simply interpret what it “says” as a language they already know, such as in the case of
         some of the Others. Remember that Common is a language that a creature must be taught.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 12: Where can it be Found?</h2>
        <h3><p>Determined in large part by what type of creature it is – but ultimately by you –
         where a creature is found either in general or by your party specifically is a very 
         important aspect of that creature’s existence; <a href="./Unliving.html" target="_blank">Unliving</a>,
         for example, are almost solely found on the Plane of Life.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 13: Does it Have Passive Abilities?</h2>
        <h3><p>Some creatures have abilities that do not require an action to use or are simply
         always active. One such example of this is the shark’s Bloodlust feature, which 
         activates immediately upon the shark tasting blood or dealing final damage to a creature.
         A creature’s passive abilities can heavily impact its difficulty.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 14: What are its Attacks, and How Much do They Hurt?</h2>
        <h3><p>For their attacks, most creatures will likely use their natural weapons, such as
         their claws or teeth. As a creature gets larger, the value of its damage die will 
         generally increase, but this is not a hard-and-fast rule, as creatures may have varying
         weapons that deal different amounts of damage and bestow different effects. When 
         determining how much damage a creature deals, keep the party’s defenses in mind: most
         DEF scores start at around 10-15 and usually increase as PCs gain levels, and you should
         keep these values in mind when deciding what effect you want this creature to have on 
         the party, i.e. should it deal final damage to them rarely, sometimes, or frequently?</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 15: Does it Have Active Abilities?</h2>
        <h3><p>Aside from a creature’s attacks, it is important to consider whether it has any
         other abilities, such as innate elemancy, shapeshifting, or anything else of note. All
         creatures also have access to the actions listed <a href="../Rulebook/Part6/Chapter2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 16: What Does it Have on It?</h2>
        <h3><p>Many creatures will have loot on their person, which they usually lose possession
         of when they die or are otherwise defeated. Additionally, many monsters and creatures 
         can be skinned or have other parts that can be scavenged off of their bodies (such as a
         dragon’s scales) to be used as armor materials.</p></h3>
        
        <h2>Step 17: How Difficult is It?</h2>
        <h3><p>Finally, you must determine how much of a challenge your creature is. There are 7
         tiers of difficulty in Twelve Elements, ranging from 0 – 6, that convey a general sense 
         of a beast’s toughness for parties of various levels. The different tiers assume a 
         monster of that tier is being faced by 4 party members of various classes of the same 
         level, and should present a decent challenge to such parties. Use the <a href="../Rulebook/Part4/LevelingUp.html" target="_blank">Tiers 
         table</a> as a guide.</p></h3>
