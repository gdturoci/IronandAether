            <p>Weapons are the bread and butter of any adventurer’s kit; any fighter worth their
             salt can tell a flail from a mace and a spear from a glaive. You choose what weapons you
             want proficiency in at character creation, and leveling up, time spent training, and/or
             feats can give you proficiency with even more. No matter what your martial preference is,
             the ability to wield your arms effectively can be the difference between a grisly death
             and adventures so wild not even the most creative minstrel could dream them up.</p>
            <p>The <b>Normal Weapons</b>, <b>Exotic Weapons</b>, and <b>Trick Weapons</b>
             tables give a list of many of the different weapons and weapon types throughout
             this ruleset. These tables include their names, price, weight, base damage, and any 
             special properties they may have.</p>
            <p><b>Base Damage.</b> The amount of damage listed for a given weapon is that
             weapon’s Base Damage; it is the damage it deals if the character wielding it has 1 
             <a href="../Part1/Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> with the type of weapon that
             that weapon belongs to. For every <a href="../Part1/Chapter3.html">proficiency</a>
             above 1 that a character has with that weapon type, the amount of damage die rolled
             in addition to the base damage is increased by 1.</p>
            <p><b>Properties.</b> The properties of a weapon give a list of any special 
             characteristics a weapon may have, if any:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ammunition.</b> Weapons with the Ammunition property require a specified amount of 
                     projectiles to be loaded into them before you can attack with them. Weapons with this 
                     property have their range/long range in feet listed next to their ammunition types. 
                     Attacks with the weapon made in their standard range are made normally; attacks made at 
                     long range and at melee range are made with disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><b>Description.</b> Some weapons have special abilities or characteristics to them that
                     can’t be summarized in just a couple of words. These weapons have the Description property,
                     and their unique property is described in detail in their weapon description at the end of 
                     the list.</li>
                    <li><b>DEX(*).</b> Weapons with the DEX property can use DEX for their attacks instead of STR
                     if the player using them so wishes; without this property, a weapon can only use STR for its
                     attacks, unless otherwise stated by a special exception. Additionally, if a weapon has the DEX*
                     property, then the wielder must use their DEX score when making attacks with this weapon.</li>
                    <li><b>Long.</b> Some melee weapons have a 10-foot range, longer than the standard 5 feet that 
                     most melee weapons have. These weapons have the Long property, and if they have a further reach
                     than 10 feet, their range (in feet) will be listed in parentheses next to this property. In narrow
                     spaces, attacks with weapons with this property have disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><b>Reload.</b> A weapon that requires <u>></u> 1 action(s) to be reloaded has the Reload property;
                     the number of actions or time required will be given in parentheses next to the property.</li>
                    <li><b>STR x.</b> A weapon with “STR x” (e.g. STR 3) requires a STR score <u>></u> the value given in 
                     order to be wielded.</li>
                    <li><b>Two-handed.</b> Weapons with the Two-handed property are large and hefty, requiring two hands
                     to be able to effectively wield in battle. Weapons with this property cannot be dual-wielded without
                     the aid of the “Two-handed Dual-Wielding” classless feat.</li>
                </ul>

            <p><b>Bola.</b> Bolas are a typed of throwing weapon consisting of two weights
             linked together by a length of durable cord, usually rope or chain. When thrown at a 
             target, they must make a Reflex save contested against your DEX check or be 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">grappled</a> as the bola wraps around 
             them. They can escape by either using an action to destroy the cord or by making a STR
             check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes an action.</p>
            <p><b>Boomerang.</b> A boomerang is a flattened and curved piece of wood or light metal;
             though most boomerangs are a single length of wood bent at almost 90 degrees towards the 
             middle, other variations do exist. In any case, a boomerang is a ranged weapon that is 
             designed to return to the user after being thrown. When attacking with this weapon, if it
             hits nothing during its flight path, it returns to you.</p>
            <p><b>Flamethrower.</b> A firearm that belches a column of intense flames, a 
             flamethrower can be an incredibly powerful and useful tool. It can be fired 6 times before
             it needs to be refueled.</p>
            <p><b>Net.</b> Nets function much the same way bolas do, though their appearance
             is quite different. When thrown at a target, they must make a Reflex save contested against your
             DEX check or be <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">restrained</a> as the net 
             entangles them. They can escape by either using an action to destroy the net or by making a STR 
             check to wrestle their way out of it, which also takes an action.</p>
            <p><b>Repeater.</b> Coming in a variety of forms, such as the lever-action, 
             pump-action, or bolt-action, repeaters are rifles that, like revolvers, can be fired 6 times 
             before needing to be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Revolver.</b> Revolvers are hand-held firearms that sacrifice power for 
             accuracy and the ability to fire 6 times before needing to be reloaded, like repeaters.</p>
             
            <h2>Exotic Weapons</h2>
            <p>Exotic weapons are unique and/or rare weapons that require specialized training to be used
             effectively. Most are foreign to the vast majority; even veteran fighters are usually not quite 
             sure how to handle one when they first encounter it.</p>
            <p><b>Proficiency.</b>Proficiency with exotic weapons is not like proficiency with
             other Weapon Skills; instead, proficiency for each Exotic weapon is unique to that weapon. For 
             instance, a character with 2 proficiency with hook blades would not have the same proficiency 
             with bladed fans or tri-staves. In addition, if an Exotic weapon has the <b>Thrown</b> property,
             a character could use their proficiency with the weapon itself or their Throwing proficiency when 
             making attacks with that weapon. Similar to every other weapon skill, it takes 1 Weapon Point for
             proficiency with an Exotic weapon to increase by 1.</p>

            <p><b>Bladed Fan.</b> A bladed fan appears to be a traditional folding fan, but 
             with a razor-sharp metal edge. Typically dual-wielded but do not have to be.</p>
            <p><b>Chakram.</b> A chakram is a circular bladed weapon, disc-shaped with the blade 
             covering most of the outside edge, with the exception of a handle big enough for only one hand. This 
             weapon can be effectively wielded as either a melee or a ranged weapon.</p>
            <p><b>Cypher.</b> A cypher is akin to a shortsword with a secondary handle sticking out 
             perpendicular from the hilt, allowing it to be wielded in a way that makes it difficult to predict its 
             movements and subsequently defend against.</p>
            <p><b>Double-bladed Staff.</b> A double-bladed staff is a staff with a single or double-edged 
             blade attached at each end.</p>
            <p><b>Hook Blades.</b> Hook blades greatly resemble thin swords, with the exception that their
             ends are curved. Because of this, hook blades are often dual-wielded, so that they can quickly and easily link
             together to strike enemies further away. The hooks can also be used to grab and manipulate certain items or body
             parts, such as ankles, shoulders, tree branches, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Krull.</b> A krull looks something like a bladed star, except that this particular “star”
             is akin to 5 daggers that have been fused at the handles and the blades are slightly curved. The design of 
             the krull, with the inner half acting as a handle that can be grasped in a multitude of ways and the outer 
             half being comprised of curved blades, allows it to be effectively wielded both in melee and as a thrown weapon.</p>
            <p><b>Kyoketsu-shoge.</b> Kyoketsu-shoge are comprised of a 15 foot-long chain or cord with
             a ring of metal attached at one end and a blade at the other. The ring of metal is blunt and roughly as 
             wide as a Medium-sized creature’s hand. This is commonly used as a handle, or can have other items looped
             through it to be used as a fulcrum. The blade has its own handle and both a hook and a point. This allows
             it to be used as both an effective melee weapon and a grappling hook. Attacks made with the kyoketsu-shoge
             in confined spaces do not have disadvantage if they are against a target 5 feet away.</p>
            <p><b>Meteor Hammer.</b> A meteor hammer is a heavy weight or ball attached to a durable
             length of cord or rope, usually about 10 feet in length, that is swung to attack enemies from surprising
             and often difficult to block angles. The cord can also be used to bind enemies.</p>
            <p><b>Nun'chaku.</b> Nun’chaku, also known as nun’chuks, greatly resemble two wooden or
             metal clubs connected by a short length of chain, rope, or cord and are just as often dual-wielded as not.</p>
            <p><b>Rope Dart.</b> A rope dart is a small serrated knife (such as a kunai, which is a
             knife with a hole in the end of the handle) or dart that has a length (usually around 15 feet) of rope
             or chain tied to it; this allows for a number of creative uses, chief among them being that the weapon’s
             melee range is equal to the length of the cord. Additionally, when throwing the rope dart, you can instantly
             pull it back so long as it is within 15 feet of you. You can also pull objects weighing 5 lbs. or less to you
             using an action, so long as they are not being worn or carried.</p>
            <p><b>Tonfa.</b> A tonfa is a club with a single handle sticking perpendicular out from
             the handle, about 6 inches from one end. It can be wielded normally or while being held by the secondary 
             handle, making it difficult to predict its movements and subsequently defend against. Tonfa are often dual-wielded.</p>
            
            <h2>Trick Weapons</h2>
            <p>Trick weapons are special weapons that contain some sort of mechanical component; some transform into 
             another weapon at the behest of the character wielding it (doing so takes an action), while others have 
             alterations that make them easier to carry or allow them to fire more frequently. The mechanics of a trick 
             weapon can be figured out with a successful DC 15 Mechanics check; unless this check is passed, a character 
             cannot figure out how to properly use a Trick weapon unless they are shown how or trained in its use.</p>
            <p><b>Alternate Form.</b> Some trick weapons can transform into a different weapon at the will 
             of the wielder. This different weapon is called the Alternate Form, and it usually has its own separate shape,
             damage, and properties.</p>
            <p><b>Alternate Damage.</b> The Alternate Form of many trick weapons alters the weapon’s shape,
             often resulting in the damage that the weapon deals changing as well.</p>
            <p><b>Alternate Properties.</b> Some Alternate Forms also change the behavior of certain weapons,
             giving them different or unique properties as per their different forms.</p>
            <p><b>Limitless Possibilities.</b> Due to the very nature of trick weapons, there are almost limitless possibilities for what one might be able
             to come up with. If you come up with an idea for their own trick weapon which is not listed in the following 
             table, talk it over with your GM and try to come to an agreement over how this new trick weapon might perform
             and what it might do. Does it have an Alternate Form? Does this Alternate Form affect its damage or bring any
             new properties with it? These and more are all things that should be thought about and discussed with your DM
             before implementing your trick weapon into a campaign.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Hand.</b> An auto-crossbow is designed to be able to fire much more
             quickly than its non-trick counterpart. For the hand auto-crossbow, it can be fired thrice before it needs
             to be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Heavy.</b> A heavy auto-crossbow can be fired a maximum of five times
             before it must be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Auto-crossbow, Light.</b> Light auto-crossbows can be fired up to four times before 
             needing to be reloaded.</p>
            <p><b>Beatlash.</b> The beatlash is a series of small pieces of wood or metal that have been 
             mechanically linked together so that they can either hold tightly together as an escrima, which is their 
             primary form, or be given slack to increase their length, much like a whip.</p>
            <p><b>Bifurcated Swordstaff.</b> The bifurcated swordstaff looks and functions exactly the 
             double-bladed staff, except that much like the bladebow, the swords on the ends can come apart to become two 
             separate shortswords. Also like the bladebow, a person must be in possession of both shortswords in order to 
             rejoin the bifurcated swordstaff.</p>
            <p><b>Bladehammer.</b> The bladehammer is a two-piece trick weapon; the first piece, a claymore, 
             comprises its primary form. The second piece, a large hammer without a handle, doubles as both its sheath and 
             its alternate form; when the blade of the claymore is placed all the way inside of the “sheath”, the two pieces
             seamlessly connect and become one.</p>
            <p><b>Bladebow, Long.</b> The long bladebow looks and functions much like a regular longbow, with
             the exception that the limbs of the bow are comprised of two curved, flexible, single-edged swords, which come 
             apart at the behest of the wielder. The string of the bow is contained within one of these swords and is 
             automatically withdrawn whenever the swords come apart. When the swords are fused together once more, the loop 
             of the string emerges from the tip of the sword containing it; the other blade has a nook behind the tip that 
             the string is then looped through, allowing it to be used as a normal longbow once more. When the swords come 
             apart, they can be treated as two separate swords; however, a person must be in possession of both before the 
             bladebow can be returned to its primary form.</p>
            <p><b>Bladebow, Short.</b> The short bladebow functions exactly like the long variation, except
             that the blades are naturally smaller and look a lot like a pair of kukri knives.</p>
            <p><b>Bracer Blade.</b> The bracer blade is a small stiletto that has been designed to slide 
             mechanically in and out of a bracer that has been specially designed to contain the bracer blade. The bracer
             blade can be used for stabbing attacks while still in the bracer, or it can be voluntarily removed to be thrown.
             While withdrawn into the bracer, the bracer blade is completely undetectable; however, if it is identified, the
             person identifying it knows what it is and what it does.</p>
            <p><b>Chakram Dagger.</b> The blade of the chakram dagger, when in its primary form, perfectly 
             resembles a normal chakram; when it shifts to its alternate form, the blade uncurls and straightens to form a dagger.</p>
            <p><b>Collapsing Krull.</b> The collapsing krull is exactly like a normal krull, except that the
             blades retract into the handle at the press of a button, allowing it to be carried and handled both more easily
             and more safely.</p>
            <p><b>Collapsing Shield.</b> The collapsing shield is not a weapon, but a shield that can 
             mechanically fold together while still being worn to become more compact and portable. While not in its shield
             form, a character can use both hands completely freely, including dual-wielding and wielding weapons with the 
             Two-handed property. Otherwise, it is treated as a regular shield.</p>
            <p><b>Collapsing Spearstaff.</b> The collapsing spearstaff is a special trick weapon; as opposed
             to having two separate forms, the collapsing spearstaff technically has four: its primary form, a staff; its 
             alternate form, an escrima; and a small blade that can emerge from either end while it is in either form. Though
             it takes an action to change from the staff form to the escrima form, the blade can appear out of either end at-will.</p>
            <p><b>Gundagger.</b> The gundagger has been built as a hybrid between the pistole and a normal
             dagger; it can be used as a normal dagger as desired, but when the safety on the pommel is released, a small
             trigger appears underneath the finger guard in the handle and a small hole opens in the tip of the blade. When
             this triggered is pulled, a bullet is fired just like from a normal pistole. The gundagger must then be cleaned
             and reloaded like a normal pistole before it can be fired again, however it can still be used as a dagger until 
             it is. In addition, if the last action you performed with the gundagger was to stab a creature and you have not
             moved, you can then fire the gundagger while it is still in the given creature as part of your attack action. This
             shot is made with advantage and deals true damage.</p>
            <p><b>Gunsword.</b> The gunsword functions much like the gundagger, except that it is a fusion 
             between a broadsword and a musket instead of a dagger and a flintlock. In addition, in order to fire the gunsword,
             a character must be holding it with two hands. Like the gundagger, the gunsword can also be fired while inside a
             creature that you have just stabbed as part of your attack action. You could also pierce a creature with the gunsword,
             and then fire at another creature behind that one as part of your attack action, though this will not be made with 
             advantage or deal true damage.</p>
            <p><b>Shortwhip.</b> The shortwhip is a lot like the beatlash, except that its primary form is an 
             ordinary shortsword comprised of several tightly linked pieces, however its alternate form is a serrated whip, 
             rather than a blunt one.</p>
            <p><b>Sicklescythe.</b> In its primary form, the sicklescythe somewhat resembles a cross between a
             sickle and a khopesh; a long curved blade with a strangely elongated handle. Much like the collapsing spearstaff,
             however, this handle unfolds and elongates to become a full-blown warscythe.</p>
