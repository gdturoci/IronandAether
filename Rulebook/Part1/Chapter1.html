            <center><h1>Chapter 1: Ability Scores</h1></center>
            <p>The seven ability scores – Strength, Constitution, Agility, Dexterity, 
             Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma – are numerical representations of a 
             creature’s physical and mental attributes, and they determine its aptitude in 
             certain fields and its ability to perform a given activity. They are measured 
             from 0 to 10, with the average score for a normal adult Sentient being 2. The 
             highest a Sentient’s score can go up to by natural means is 5, but certain 
             class features, enchanted items, special abilities, or other exceptional means 
             can bring a score up to 6. Each ability is described in detail below.</p>
            
            <h2>Determining Your Scores</h2>
            <p>There are two ways to determine your scores, though your group may decide to 
             modify one of these ways or come up with one of their own:</p>
            <p><b>Roll 1d8/2 7 Times.</b> The first method is to roll 1d8 and divide the roll by 2, 
             rounding down. Record the result, then do that 6 more times, once for each score. 
             Once you have all 7, place each digit into each ability score as you desire.</p>
            <p><b>Point Buy.</b> The second method allows you to "purchase" your ability scores using
             a pool of 14 points via a 1:1 conversion rate (e.g. you can spend 2.5 points to get a
             score of 2.5). You cannot buy a score higher than 4.</p>
             <p>Some of your ability scores will almost certainly be between two whole numbers,
             e.g. .5, 1.5, 2.5, etc.; for these scores, whenever you are using them to
             calculate something, such as your Health or Dodge, if the result is x.5, round the
             result down. For example, if your character has an AGI of 2.5, a DEX  of 3, and is
             Small, then their Dodge would be 2.5 + 3 - 2, which is 3.5; since this is halfway
             between two whole values, it is rounded down to 3. This also applies to checks of all 
             kinds.</p>
            <p>When deciding stats, it is heavily recommended that your group democratically decide
             which method they wish to use. Ability scores can be halfway between two whole
             numbers (1.5, 2.5, etc.) but cannot be any other non-whole value.</p>
            
            <h2>Skill Bonuses</h2>
            <p>Each ability score also doubles as a bonus to each associated skill, which simply
             means that when making a check on one of those skills, you add your ability score 
             (rounded down) to the result of that check.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Checks</h2>
            <p>In I&A, when a character wishes to perform any sort of difficult 
             or complex action, they must make what is called a <b>skill check</b>. If the action 
             they wish to perform directly relates or corresponds to an <a href="./Chapter2.html">Action Skill</a> 
             they are proficient in, they must roll a number of d10s proportionate to their
             <a href="./Chapter3.html">proficiency</a> in that skill. However, if they are attempting
             a difficult action that does not fit the criteria for any of the Action Skills, then 
             they make what is called an <b>ability check</b>. To do this, simply roll a number of 
             d10s equal to the appropriate ability score and add up the rolls; if the result is 
             <u>></u> the DR, you succeed. If the given ability score is 0 or 0.5, roll 1d10/2 
             (rounded up).</p>
            <p>For both skill checks and ability checks, consider reducing the DR based on how
             your players describe how they wish to perform the action; if they explicitly point
             out that they are going out of their way to make what they are attempting easier or
             if they roleplay the check well, the DR should be reduced accordingly.</p>
            <p><b>Partial Successes.</b> Instead of having success or failure be a binary,
             consider implementing the following: if a character fails a check by a relatively
             small amount, they achieve a Partial Success, which allows the character to make
             progress towards their goal without explicitly succeeding, usually granting them 
             the opportunity to make an additional check to try to further their progress
             towards/meet their goal (if you are uncertain as to how to implement a partial
             success for a given task, consider simply having them eventually succeed after
             attempting the task for a long time).<br>
            <p><b>Check Difficulty.</b> Presented here are two tables that should give an idea
             of the relative difficulty of various tasks. GMs can use either table at their 
             discretion: the left gives a list of static difficulties that can be referenced
             quickly and easily, while the right outlines how to calculate dynamic DRs given a
             task's relative difficulty.</p>

            <h2>Using Averages</h2>
            <p>As ability scores become higher and higher, particularly from 5 and up, 
             rolling for checks of various sorts can become tedious and time-consuming. Instead, 
             consider using the average of the rolls to speed things up; once a score reaches 5, 
             use the average result of the first 4 d10s (22), and then roll any remaining d10s. For 
             example, if a character makes a STR check when their STR is 5, they can choose
             to either roll 5d10 or roll 1d10 + 22 to determine the result of their check. This can 
             also apply to skill checks, saves, and attacks, though using this for attacks is not 
             recommended.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <button type="button" class="grid">Strength (STR)</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                        Strength is the measure of your character’s ability to push, pull, or exert any 
                        raw physical force on the world around them. It is used to muscle your way through 
                        certain situations and deal damage with most weapons. STR is also used to determine 
                        a creature’s <a href="./Chapter8.html">carrying capacity</a> before 
                        becoming encumbered. A creature that is encumbered (meaning they have surpassed their 
                        carrying capacity) is <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">slowed</a> and cannot climb or
                        swim. If they have surpassed their carrying capacity by <u>></u> 150% (e.g. your 
                        carrying capacity is 100 and you’re carrying 150 pounds) then they are 
                        <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">incapacitated</a>. Your STR also partially 
                        determines your <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a>.

                        Constitution measures your body’s overall fortitude and toughness, as well as your 
                         stamina and your ability to resist the effects of poison and disease. CON is used 
                         when determining your <a href="./Chapter4.html">Health</a> and
                         <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a>. If your CON at any point increases or
                         decreases to a whole number, your Health immediately increases or decreases by an
                         amount equal to your level, e.g. if your CON score increases from
                         2.5 to 3 and you are level 5, your Health immediately increases by 5.

                        Agility measures a character's ability to move quickly and perform body-wide feats
                         of finesse, whereas DEX is more closely tied to hand-eye coordination and precise, 
                         nimble movements using one's hands and feet. Your AGI or DEX score determines your 
                         initiative bonus, and AGI and DEX together measure one's <a href="./Chapter5.html">Dodge</a>

                         calculations and reason things out logically. Your INT may partially determine your

                        Charisma determines your ability to command the attention of those

                         social context, from commanding and inspiring them to intimidating and
                         deceiving them. A high CHA score does not necessarily mean that the 
                         character is well-loved by all around them (though this is frequently
                         the case), just that they have a very demanding and noticeable presence.
                         Your CHA score also partially determines your <a href="./Chapter6.html">Willpower</a> score.
