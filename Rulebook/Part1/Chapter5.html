            <center><h1>Chapter 5: Defenses</h1></center>
            <p>Whether you’re defending a caravan from bandits on the road or plundering an 
             ancient lost temple, one thing holds true between adventurers of all levels, backgrounds,
             and skillsets: a strong offense will only get you so far. Any adventurer hoping to last
             more than a day or two needs a something to defend themselves in the event things go 
             south. For some, this means being quicker than a bullet with unmatched reflexes. To 
             others, this means thick plates of metal that no Sentient’s sword nor dragon’s tooth 
             could penetrate. And for all, a weak mind will get you about as far as an unstrung bow.</p>
            <p>In Iron & Aether, there are 2 primary forms of defense that an adventurer has at 
             their disposal: their Dodge, which is a quantification of how well your character can
             move out of danger’s way, and their Armor, which details how much the attacks that do
             hit them get blocked by what they’re wearing (their <a href="./Chapter6.html">Fortitude
             and Willpower</a> are also used to protect them from poison and psychic damage 
             respectively). Your Armor and Dodge scores combined form your Defense (DEF) and Ranged 
             Defense (RaDEF) scores.</p>
            
            <h2>Defense and Ranged Defense</h2>
            <p>The Defense (DEF) of a creature is a number that tells the player and the 
             DM how much damage is reduced from incoming melee attacks, and is determined by 
             adding the creature’s Armor and Dodge scores; the lowest a creature’s DEF score 
             can be is 0. A creature’s Ranged Defense (RaDEF) functions very similarly, except 
             that it is applied to any and all attacks made at range, including explosives, 
             ranged spells, traps, and the like. RaDEF is determined by adding a creature’s 
             DEF score to the RaDEF bonus they get from their <a href="./Chapter8.html">Size.</a></p>
            <p>To find out how much damage has been dealt to a creature, take the result of the 
             attack roll and subtract the target’s DEF or RaDEF score. This damage is referred to as
             the final damage of the attack.</p>
            
            <h2>Armor</h2>
            <p>A character’s Armor score tells them how well-defended they are from attacks 
             that connect with their physical bodies; a low Armor score means that the gear your 
             character is wearing hardly protects them, while a high Armor score means that they 
             are quite well-defended, likely wearing thick plates of steel or something enchanted. 
             In short, the higher your Armor score, the less damage you’ll be taking; however, 
             heavier armor will weigh you down and restrain your Dodge score, as well as make it 
             more difficult to travel on foot (refer to <a href="../Part5/Chapter3.html">Part 5: Equipment, Chapter 3: Armor</a>
             for more information).</p>
            <p>Your Armor score is comprised of your heritage and the actual armor you 
             are wearing on your body; the lowest a Sentient’s Armor score can be is 1.</p>
            
            <h2>Dodge</h2>
            <p>Your Dodge score - separate from the Dodge Penalty determined by your Size -
             quantifies your character’s ability to avoid immediate danger: it 
             is a collection of their reflexes, defensive agility, instinct for danger, and, to a certain 
             extent, their hand-eye coordination. A high Dodge score means that hardly anything, from a 
             flying arrow to a swung blade, will get anywhere near you. The higher your Dodge score is, 
             the less harm will touch you; however, heavy armor and equipment will reduce and constrain 
             your Dodge score. The lowest a creature’s Dodge score can be is 0.<br>
            <p>Your Dodge score is determined by your <a href="./Chapter8.html">Size</a>
             and your AGI and DEX modifiers, and is directly modified by the Armor you are wearing:
            <p>Light, Medium, or no armor: Dodge = size penalty + AGI score + DEX score;
            <p>Heavy armor: Dodge = size penalty + AGI score.</p>
            
            <h2>Fortitude and Willpower</h2>
            <p>In the <a href="./Chapter6.html">next chapter</a>, another type of defense 
             is covered: saves. Two of these saves, Fortitude and Willpower, also function as forms
             of defense against poison and psychic damage respectively.</p>
            
            <h2>Resistances and Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>Some creatures have resistances and vulnerabilities to certain types of damage; this
             just means that they take more or less damage from an attack that deals damage of that
             type. If a creature is resistant to an attack’s damage, then the final damage dealt to
             them by that attack is halved (rounded down). If a creature is vulnerable to an attack’s
             damage, then the final damage dealt to them by that attack is doubled.</p>
