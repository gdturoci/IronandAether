            <p>Characters are able to perform a variety of actions as they explore and interact
             with the world during their adventures. These actions can be performed in or out of 
             combat, and many can be performed as reactions.</p>
            <p>During each round of combat, a creature can perform up to 2 actions on
             their turn and 1 reaction which can be used during any other creature’s turn. Very 
             rarely, certain special actions may take two or more actions to perform, or certain 
             class features, spells, enchanted items, or other special circumstances may grant a 
             creature more actions or reactions.</p>

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        When a creature takes this action, they are choosing to attack a creature, character,
                         or object within range using their currently equipped weaponry, their spells, or 
                         whatever else they may wish to use. When making an attack with a weapon, unless the 
                         weapon has the “DEX” property, add your STR score to the roll.<br>
                        The number of attacks you can make is altered by your <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">DEX score</a>.

                        To blind a creature, the blinder must make a DEX check contested against the target’s
                         Reflex save. On a success, the target is <a href="./Chapter3.html">blinded</a>
                         until they use an action to remove the blinding element from their eyes.

                        Whatever weapons a character is holding at any given point during combat are their 
                         equipped weapons, and they can take the Attack action with only those weapons unless 
                         they choose to swap out one weapon for another. You can change only 1 equipped weapon
                         per action.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        To disarm a creature, the disarmer must make a Sleight of Hand or STR check contested
                         by the DEX or STR check of the creature they are attempting to disarm. On a success, 
                         their weapon is plucked out of their hand and thrown up to 10 feet away in a direction
                         of the disarmer’s choosing. The weapon can be caught by you or another person in the 
                         weapon’s path with a successful DR 15 Sleight of Hand check, provided the being 
                         attempting to catch it has an empty hand.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        A creature disengages when they wish to leave the melee range of all opponents they 
                         are currently in melee range of without provoking any opportunity attacks. If they enter
                         a new opponent’s melee range, they must disengage again if they wish to continue 
                         avoiding opportunity attacks.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        Evading is a being’s way of preparing for an incoming attack or harmful effect and 
                         bracing themselves against it. When a creature takes this action, their Dodge score is 
                         doubled and all attacks and damage-dealing effects have disadvantage against them until
                         the start of their next turn; they also have advantage on all <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Reflex saves</a>
                         for the same period.

                        When choosing to grapple another creature, the grappler must make a STR or DEX check
                         contested against the <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Reflex save</a>
                         of the target. On a success, the target is <a href="./Chapter3.html">grappled</a>
                         by the grappler, and may take an action on their turn to make a STR or DEX check to free
                         themselves contested against the grappler’s STR or DEX check.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        A creature that helps is choosing to aid another character with whatever they are 
                         doing. This gives the being they are aiding advantage on whatever they do on their next
                         turn.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        The Hide action is used when a creature wishes to avoid being spotted by another 
                         entity. In order to hide, a creature needs something to hide behind/in and must make a
                         Stealth check contested by the searching party’s Perception check.

                    <button type="button" class="grid">Hold Action</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                        A creature can hold their action if they wish to wait for a specific event to occur 
                         in their immediate environment before taking that action, at which point they can take 
                         the action as normal. When deciding to hold their action, a player must describe the 
                         event that will trigger the desired action, such as an enemy walking through a doorway
                         or an ambush being sprung.

                    <button type="button" class="grid">Jump</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                        Your maximum jump height in feet is equivalent to your STR score, while your maximum
                         jump length in feet is twice your STR score; with a running start, it becomes double
                         that. A running start requires a character to run uninterrupted for at least 10 feet in
                         a straight line before the jump.

                    <button type="button" class="grid">Improvise</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                        This is arguably the most loosely-definable action, since it can apply to almost 
                         infinitely different situations. This action is used when a creature wishes to interact
                         with their environment in such a way that is not otherwise described here; examples 
                         include propping a chair up against a door, flipping a table over to use it as cover,
                         or smashing through a glass pane. It is up to the DM whether the action a creature 
                         wishes to improvise is doable and, if it is, how difficult it is to do.

                    <button type="button" class="grid">Move</button>
                    <div class="gridtent">
                        You move in a direction of your choosing, to a distance of your choosing, so long as
                         you have enough movement to get there and nothing is in your way. Moving through 
                         difficult terrain and moving while <a href="./Chapter3.html">prone</a>
                         requires twice as much movement as moving through normal terrain, unless otherwise 
                         stated by a special exception. For example, if a character with 30 feet of movement
                         tried to move through difficult terrain, they could only move through 15 feet of it at
                         most.<br>
                        Additionally, it is very important to note that when a character moves,
                         they do not need to use all of their movement at once, i.e. once they decide to move 
                         that action lasts until the end of their turn or they use all of their movement, 
                         whichever comes first, e.g. you can move 15 feet, take the Attack action, and then move
                         another 15 feet if you so desired. The amount of movement at your disposal is determined
                         by your <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">AGI score</a>.

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        Using almost any weapon and/or appropriate item, a creature can pin another to a 
                         surface, usually by impaling their clothes to that surface or weighing them down with
                         something heavy. When a creature takes this action, they must make a STR or DEX check
                         (DM’s choice) contested against the target’s <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude or Reflex</a>
                         save (DM’s choice). If the pinner wins the contest, the target is considered <a href="./Chapter13.html">grappled</a>
                         by whatever is pinning them, and can take an action on their next turn to make a STR 
                         check to free themselves. The DR for this check is the result of the pinner’s original
                         STR or DEX check.

                         success, they are shoved a number of feet equal to twice the shover’s STR score (minimum 5

                        To trip another creature, make a STR or DEX check contested against their <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude or Reflex save</a>;

                    <div class="gridtent">
                        This action is performed whenever a creature wishes to use an item that can be found 
                         either in their immediate environment or their inventory. A couple of examples would be
                         quaffing a potion or opening a container. If the item is large and/or would take a large
                         amount of time and/or effort to use, then it may require more than one action to perform.

            <p>Reactions are performed in immediate response to something in the environment;
             every creature has at least 1 reaction at their disposal each round, which can be used 
             on any turn other than their own. As stated above, there are some features that add to
             a character’s list of possible reactions, but those are not described here.</p>

                        An opportunity attack, or attack of opportunity, can be performed whenever a creature
                         leaves the melee range of another creature, allowing them to take the chance to cause
                         them injury. The Disengage action can be used to avoid attacks of opportunity.
