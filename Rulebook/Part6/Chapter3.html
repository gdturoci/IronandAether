            <center><h1>Chapter 3: Conditions</h1></center>
            <p>There are many, many circumstances under which a character may become somehow 
             impaired, such as losing their sight or ability to move, or gaining an awful feeling in
             their body or mind that makes performing actions more difficult. Listed and described
             here are several such conditions and their effects on a creature. Several conditions 
             refer to another condition in their description; in such cases, the effects stack with
             each other.</p>
            
            <p><b>Blinded.</b> A blinded creature is unable to see, and as a result, all attacks 
             against them have advantage, all attacks by them have disadvantage, and they 
             automatically fail all sight-based skill and ability checks.</p>
            <p><b>Charmed.</b> The charmed condition grants advantage to all social 
             skill and ability checks when made by the charmer to the charmed; in addition, the
             charmed creature cannot willingly attack the charmer.</p>
            <p><b>Deafened.</b> A deafened creature cannot hear, and automatically 
             fails any and all hearing-based skill and ability checks. It also has disadvantage on 
             Perception checks.</p>
            <p><b>Frightened.</b> When a creature is frightened, it makes all of its 
             skill and ability checks with disadvantage while it can see the source of its fear, 
             which it cannot willingly move closer to.</p>
            <p><b>Grappled.</b> A grappled creature cannot move and cannot benefit to
             any bonuses to its movement. Attacks made against a grappled creature by the creature 
             grappling it have advantage. The condition ends if something forcibly removes the 
             victim from the grappler’s grasp or if the grappler lets them go.</p>
            <p><b>Incapacitated.</b> An incapacitated creature cannot move and cannot
             take any actions or reactions except speech.</p>
            <p><b>Invisible.</b> A creature that is invisible cannot be visually 
             perceived unless by special exception and has advantage on sight-based Stealth checks. 
             They can still be perceived by disturbances in their environment however, such as the 
             noises they make or any tracks they leave behind. In addition, attacks that they make 
             against creatures who cannot see them have advantage and attacks against them by 
             creatures who cannot see them have disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Paralyzed.</b> A paralyzed creature is <b>incapacitated</b> and its 
             Dodge score is reduced to 0.</p>
            <p><b>Petrified.</b> A petrified creature is completely frozen as it is 
             turned to ice, stone, or a similar material. It cannot regain or lose Health or take any
             kind of action or reaction. It is immune to psychic damage, automatically passes all 
             <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower saves</a>, its <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a>
             score becomes 5, its Dodge score becomes 0, and its Armor score becomes 20; if it takes
             any final damage, it starts to break apart, the severity of which being up to the amount
             of final damage taken and the DM’s discretion.</p>
            <p><b>Prone.</b> A prone creature can only crawl unless it uses an action
             to stand up. All attacks made by a prone creature have disadvantage, except Firearm 
             weapon attacks, which have advantage. Melee attacks against a prone creature have 
             advantage, while ranged attacks have disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Restrained.</b> A restrained creature is also considered <b>grappled</b>,
             however it can no longer make attacks and attacks against it have advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Sickened.</b> A sickened creature feels illness take root somewhere
             in their body, crippling them from the inside. All of a sickened creature’s checks, 
             attacks, and saves are made with disadvantage, and attacks against it have advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Slowed.</b> A slowed creature can only perform one action on its 
             turn, cannot use reactions, has its Dodge score reduced by half, and performs its 
             attacks with disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Stunned.</b> A stunned creature is considered <b>incapacitated</b>,
             however can only speak falteringly and in stutters. In addition, attacks against it have
             advantage, and it makes all saves with disadvantage.</p>
            <p><b>Unconscious.</b> An unconscious creature is <b>incapacitated</b>,
             cannot speak, and is completely unaware of its surroundings. It drops whatever it is
             holding in its hands and falls <b>prone</b> unless something physically prevents it from
             doing so, and its Dodge score is reduced to 0.</p>
