            <center><h1>Chapter 13: Traps</h1></center>
            <p>Bane to and slayer of many an adventurer, traps can be found almost anywhere, but
             are most commonly found in diabolically designed dungeons, from clever and conniving 
             bandit lairs to the tombs of greedy and paranoid long-dead rulers. Just as varied as 
             the location of traps is the nature of them; they can be a complicated mess of shooting
             arrows and swinging blades, or as simple as a 10-foot-deep pit covered in leaves and 
             thin planks.</p>
            <p>Three types of traps exist in I&A, and two are
             described in detail in this chapter: simple and complex. Simple traps are defined by 
             having at least 1 of 2 characteristics: they are either mechanically simple and can be 
             constructed relatively easily with materials on-hand, and/or they perform only one 
             action after being triggered, and must then be reset (either automatically or manually)
             before they can do anything else. Complex traps can perform multiple actions 
             autonomously before they shut down and/or need to be reset.</p>
            <p>The third type of traps, which are not covered here, are arcane traps,
             which are typically spells that have been set as a trap or a power of an enchanted item.</p>
            
            <h2>Detecting Traps</h2>
            <p>Most every trap has a visible or otherwise detectable component of some sort – a 
             pressure plate that sticks out, a tripwire that stands apart from the environment, 
             loose, creaking timbers ready to give way at any moment, etc. If the visible component
             of a trap is exceedingly obvious, it can be assumed any nearby creatures see it 
             immediately without the need for a check – though it is worth noting that just because
             a component of a trap is visible doesn’t mean its triggering mechanism is as well, 
             though it may make spotting the trigger easier.</p>
            <p>If a trap’s trigger is not obviously detectable and the players state
             that their characters are looking for traps or other dangers, the GM can have them make
             Perception checks to look for them (arcane traps may also be detected with a successful
             Arcana check). Once a trap or one of its components is spotted, a character can make a
             Mechanics/Arcana check to discern how the trap works, its damage, where the trigger is,
             etc. The amount and nature of information gained is determined by how well the check
             succeeded and the GM’s discretion.</p>
            
            <h2>Disabling Traps</h2>
            <p>Once a trap and/or its trigger has been spotted, it can usually be safely 
             circumvented by simply avoiding it. Much of the time, however, the safer option – if for
             no other reason than peace of mind – may be to disable the trap, either by damaging 
             it/its trigger and making it utterly useless, or by (temporarily) jamming the 
             mechanisms of the trap so that it no longer works, but could likely be repaired with
             some effort. Thieving Tools will almost always accomplish the desired effect, but they
             are not explicitly necessary most of the time, e.g. a normal dagger can cut a tripwire 
             just fine (usually), or rocks can be stuffed into arrow slits to completely block them.
             The PCs may even be able to trigger a trap from a safe distance, expending it or giving
             themselves time until the trap resets to bypass it (this method is especially effective
             with arcane traps).</p>
            <p>If a trap has a disable DR, it will be specified in its description; 
             if a character attempting to disarm the trap does not get a <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">partial
             success</a>, the trap triggers.</p>
            
            <h2>Triggering Traps</h2>
            <p>Each and every trap has a trigger, a specific mechanism that will release the 
             trap’s effects onto anyone and anything in the area of effect. The sample triggers given
             later assume the trigger is uncovered, unprotected, and unmodified in any way.</p>
             
            <h2>Trap Effects</h2>
            <p>Many traps have many different effects. Though most traps do deal damage and many
             are meant to kill, this is not always the case; many are designed to just hinder, maim,
             or inconvenience, or a series of traps may be designed to whittle away at a group’s 
             resources. When designing traps for your campaigns and dungeons, consider both the 
             specific effects of the trap – does it deal damage, restrain a person(s), is it a puzzle
             unto itself, etc. – and the overall purpose of the trap – is it designed to whittle 
             away at intruders, buy time for an enemy to escape, protect a priceless artifact, or 
             something else entirely? Be creative and have fun with it, but try to ensure that your
             traps have a purpose and are not simply a hazard for hazard’s sake.</p>
            
            <h2>Sample Traps</h2>
            <p>Given here are a smattering of example traps designed to be easily understandable,
             modifiable, and inspirational, and to give an idea of how to design your own traps. All
             the traps given are mechanical in nature, and each trap will specify if it is simple or
             complex. The trap’s sample trigger(s) (including spot and disable DRs), area of effect,
             effects, and Mechanics DR will all be specified, as well as a couple of possible 
             modifications for different versions of the trap. Every trap described will be assumed
             to be in its most simple, plain, unmodified, and obvious form.</p>

                        <b>Area of Effect.</b> May vary, but usually the area immediately around the alarm.
                        <b>Effects.</b> The purpose of an alarm is usually to alert the setter of the trap 
                         to any intruders without directly harming the intruders, almost always through loud
                         and disruptive noise that starts immediately upon the trap being triggered. The 
                         source of the noise can be bells, falling objects, a machine specifically designed
                         as an alarm, or any other such implement.<br>
                        <b>Mechanics DR.</b> Pressure plate: 15 – Tripwire: 6.<br>

                        <b>Deafening Alarm.</b>With this variation, the source of the noise is extremely loud
                         and sudden, and deliberately placed next to the trap trigger. When this version of 
                         the trap is triggered, any creatures within 5 feet of the source of the noise 
                         (usually directly adjacent to the trigger) take 1d6 sonic final damage and must 
                         succeed on a DR 15 <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude save</a>
                         or be <a href="./Chapter3.html">deafened</a> for 1 minute. The 
                         Mechanics DR for this version of the trap is 20 (pressure plate)/10 (tripwire), and
                         any creature that knows how it works has advantage on their save.

                        <b>Area of Effect.</b> Any amount of surface area the GM desires.<br>
                        <b>Effects.</b> When this trap is triggered, the area of effect immediately ignites 
                         and starts burning until the blaze’s fuel runs out, dealing 2d8 burn damage whenever
                         a creature enters its area of effect and at the start of each affected creature’s 
                         turns.<br>
                        <b>Mechanics DR.</b> Pressure plate: 20 – Tripwire: 10.<br>
                        <i>Sample Modifications</i><br>
                        <b>Electrified Surface.</b> In this version of the trap, the area of effect becomes 
                         electrified instead of lighting on fire. The Mechanics DR for this version of the 
                         trap is 25 (pressure plate)/20 (tripwire).<br>
                        <b>Frictionless Surface.</b> This version of the trap may or may not trigger at all;
                         the surface itself may simply be frictionless by nature, or if there is a trigger,
                         some sort of liquid or other slickening agent may, for all intents and purposes, 
                         make the surface frictionless. There is no Spot DR for the trigger-less version of
                         this trap, but the surface itself has a Mechanics DR of 10; for the triggered 
                         version, the Spot DRs are the same, and the Mechanics DRs become 15 (pressure plate)/10 
                         (tripwire).

                        <b>Effects.</b> A cave-in trap, as the name would imply, causes a cave-in over the 
                         area of effect, dealing an appropriate amount of physical damage. The amount of 
                         damage this trap deals may vary greatly depending on the materials that are caving
                         in (natural stone, rotting wood, etc.) and the amount of them (tons of rock and 
                         stone, a few timbers, etc.)<br>
                        <b>Mechanics DR.</b> Explosives: 8 – Loose timbers: 5 – Opening door: 15 – Pressure
                         plate: 10 – Tripwire: 10.<br>
                        <i>Sample Modifications</i><br>
                        <b>Collapsing Building.</b> If a cave-in would cause more than 1 floor to collapse on
                         a creature, then for every extra floor, increase the damage the trap deals by a 
                         factor of 1. For example, if a normal wooden roof cave-in would cause 2d6 damage to
                         its victims, then a 2-story wooden cave-in should deal 4d6, 3 stories would be 6d6,
                         etc.<br>
                        <b>Seal-in.</b> This version of this trap is not designed to deal damage, though it 
                         still can. Instead, a seal-in trap is designed to cause a cave-in around 1 or more 
                         of the immediate area’s entrances/exits.

                        <b>Sample Triggers.</b> Loose timbers: Spot DR 5, disable DR 20 (Carpentry Tools) – 
                         Pressure plate: Spot DR 15, disable DR 12 (STR/DEX).<br>
                        <b>Area of Effect.</b> The area between any length of two or more walls that are 
                         facing each other.<br>
                        <b>Effects.</b> This trap causes two or more walls that are facing each other to 
                         slide forward towards each other (at a rate of speed determined by the GM), with the
                         goal of crushing anything between them. If a strong enough object is placed between
                         them, the closing can be delayed until the pressure destroys the item (or the walls,
                         depending on their strength). If any creatures in the area of effect do not manage 
                         to leave the area before the walls start to press on them, their movement will be
                         halved and they will take 4d12 physical damage (reduced only by their Armor score)
                         at the start of each of their turns. If a character being crushed is reduced to 0 
                         Health, they are crushed and killed instantly.<br>
                        <b>Mechanics DR.</b> Loose timbers: 10 – Pressure plate: 15.<br>
                        <i>Sample Modifications</i><br>
                        <b>Spiked Walls.</b> The spiked walls modification is very similar to the original 
                         version, except that spikes sprout from the walls as or before they start closing, 
                         increasing the damage dealt by the crushing walls – or preventing them from closing
                         entirely, possibly sparing the quick-thinking adventurer.<br>
                        <b>Rising Floor/Lowering Ceiling.</b> This version of the trap raises the floor to 
                         the ceiling or vice versa, having much the same effect as the standard version, 
                         though it may become more difficult to leave the area of effect.

                        <b>Effects.</b> An absolute classic, this trap causes a projectile of the GM’s 
                         choice to fly towards the victim(s) after being fired from an appropriate mechanism,
                         be it a jerry-rigged crossbow or something more complex that fires a multitude of 
                         projectiles over a larger area. For each projectile being fired, assume the damage
                         each one deals is equal to 2 proficiency with the appropriate weapon, e.g. 3 light
                         crossbow bolts being fired would deal 6d6 physical damage.<br>

                        <b>Flaming Projectiles.</b> This modification of the trap is very similar to the 
                         base form, except that the projectiles in question are now on fire, dealing 1d4
                         additional burn damage per projectile (this does not work with bullets or miniballs).

                         immediately dangerous fluid, such as acid or lava. Assume the danger deals 1d8 of 
                         the appropriate damage on the first round and an additional d8 every round after 
                         that. The damage is taken at the start of a character’s turn and is only reduced by
                         their Armor score if their armor is enchanted.<br>
