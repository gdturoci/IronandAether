                 claws, and prehensile tails. Horns of various lengths and styles decorate their heads,

                 caustic, electric, freeze, poison, rot, or sonic. The damage this

                <b>Base Movement.</b> Being Small/Medium makes your base Movement 25/30 feet.<br>
                <b>Adaptability.</b> Your people have adapted to survive in a given environment,
                 granting you resistance to one damage type that is not fatigue, physical, or 
                 true. If you select poison, you have advantage on saves against poisons and 
                 diseases.<br>

                <b>Appearance.</b> Kobolds are covered head-to-toe in scales across the color
                 spectrum, usually the same as the environment their clan has survived in for several
                 generations. Kobolds also have horns on their heads or spines running down their 
                 backs, though the lengths and styles of these vary from clan to clan and Kobold to
