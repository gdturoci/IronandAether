            <center><h1>Chapter 4: Relics</h1></center>
            
            <p>Relics are enchanted items that are so incredibly, wondrously powerful, and the 
             process to create them so complex and beyond Sentient understanding, that their kind 
             cannot be replicated; in short, Sentients cannot recreate the power of relics, which may
             be for the best, as many of them hold incredible destructive potential within them. So 
             great is their power that simply by attuning to them – which, strangely enough, takes 
             only an hour – the user will be both blessed with some sort of boon and cursed in some
             way.</p>
            <p>You can attune to only one relic at a time and cannot unattune from it
             without destroying the relic. The features, including boons and curses, bestowed by a 
             relic you have attuned to last until the relic is destroyed or you die; some relic 
             benefits require the relic to be on your person, and a relic’s description will say if
             this is the case. If you die and are resurrected within 24 hours, such as through a 
             Phylactery, the relic is still attuned to you; however, if you die and are not
             resurrected within that time, the relic is no longer attuned to you. During this 24 
             hours another person cannot attune to the relic. Lastly, if you ever lose or misplace 
             the relic, it reappears in your possession next midnight.</p>
            <p>Given here is a list of relics, along with the boons and curses gained 
             from attuning to them, and some lore to give them some backstory and an idea of their power,
             though the information given is vague enough to allow the GM to modify it at their 
             leisure. Any and all of the information pertaining to a relic, from their very existence
             to their powers, may be known or unknown to the characters, or even to the common 
             populace, depending on the nature and history of your GM’s world and their discretion. 
             You may learn this knowledge through research, from an ally, or through attuning to the
             relic itself.</p>
            <p>In addition to its normal properties, which are gained when the user 
             attunes to the relic, each relic can also be awakened, which occurs after the user has 
             unlocked the relic’s true inner potential. The requirements to do this vary from relic 
             to relic, and a relic’s description will say what it needs in order to awaken.</p>
            <p>Lastly, destroying a relic is, as one might imagine, not easy. Each 
             relic has its own special requirements to be destroyed, detailed in the relic’s 
             description; otherwise, the relic is immune to damage.</p>
             
            <h2>Relic Boons</h2>
            <p>Given here is a list of boons, both major and minor, that a relic may bestow when
             the user attunes to it. The boons should be decided by the GM; when deciding what boons
             the attuning character receives, you may pick and choose or roll appropriately. If a boon
             has a * at the end of it, it cannot be granted more than once.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Lore.</b> Throughout the pages of history this mythical sword has gone by many 
                 names: Excalibur, Masamune, Tyrfing, Andúril. Throughout all of the legends, one 
                 commonality arises: a blade of great and unmatched power, that makes kings and 
                 legends of its wielders. It is said that, throughout its life, Excalibur has slain 
                 millions, be it through warfare, single combat, public execution, or any other 
                 method. Today, no Sentient can possibly know where history ends and legends begin, 
                 but any who wield this mythical blade quickly find that with a weapon like this at 
                 your side, such feats are not outside the realm of possibility.</p>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> Excalibur bestows the following boons and
                 curses: 2 Minor Boons, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curse, and 1 Major Curse. Upon 
                 awakening, it bestows 1 more Major Boon and 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> When attuned to Excalibur, the user’s STR or DEX
                 (their choice) score immediately increases by .5, to a maximum of 6. Additionally, 
                 while Excalibur is always described as a sword, the user can use an action to 
                 transform it into any Small, Medium, or Large weapon. Whatever form the weapon 
                 takes, and regardless of the user’s proficiency with the appropriate skill, attacks
                 with it are made at 5 proficiency and have a +5 bonus. At the start of combat, the
                 user also gains a +1d6 bonus to their initiative roll. Additionally, the mythical
                 blade grants a +3 bonus to the user’s Armor score so long as Excalibur is on their
                 person.</p>
                <p>Excalibur’s final feature is also its most noteworthy: at any time
                 while the user is holding it, they can choose to instantly engulf the blade in ice,
                 fire, lightning, acid, venom, or psychic energy. Whichever they choose, the sword 
                 deals one extra die of damage of the appropriate type: freeze for ice, burn for
                 fire, electric for lightning, caustic for acid, poison for venom, or psychic for 
                 psychic energy. So, if Excalibur were to become a dagger engulfed in flame, attacks
                 made with it would deal 5d4 physical + 1d4 burning damage.</p>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Should Excalibur be wielded by a leader – such as
                 someone with royal blood or an elected ruler – its true power unlocks.</p>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> Once awakened, Excalibur’s power 
                 increases the user’s previously chosen ability score by another .5 (up to 6), and it
                 can now change form instantly. Additionally, the user’s proficiency when wielding 
                 Excalibur increases to 6, as does the bonus to its attacks.  The initiative bonus 
                 also increases to +1d12, and the +3 Armor bonus becomes +6. The last change is that
                 the damage of the chosen engulfment increases to two extra damage dice.</p>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> Somewhere in the world, legend tells of a lake
                 from whence Excalibur was gifted to its original wielder, whose name and deeds have
                 been lost to time. Many scholars and mythologists believe that, should Excalibur be 
                 returned to this lake, it would disappear from the world forever, never to be seen or
                 used again. Throwing the sword into the lake requires a successful DR 30 Willpower 
                 save; should the user fail the save, they must wait 24 hours before they can try 
                 again.</p>

                <p><b>Lore.</b> The Handcannon is a perfect marriage of firepower and arcana.
                 What appears as a single large revolver is, in fact, much more.</p>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> The Handcannon bestows the following boons
                 and curses: 1 Minor Boon, 1 Major Boon, and 2 Minor Curses. Upon awakening, it 
                 bestows 1 more Minor Boon.</p>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> For the most part, the Handcannon functions as a
                 normal revolver, except for a few notable differences: firstly, upon attuning, the 
                 user’s Firearm proficiency increases by 1, up to 6; secondly, its base 
                 damage is 1d8; and thirdly, the user gains a bonus to Handcannon attacks equal to 
                 their Firearm proficiency.</p>
                <p>The final and much more noteworthy difference between the 
                 Handcannon and an ordinary revolver is the <b>Arcane Shot</b>, which causes a random
                 arcane effect to occur every time the Handcannon is fired. Roll on the following

                <p><b>Awakening.</b> When the user fires the Handcannon at least once 
                 every day for one year, it will awaken. As it gets closer to awakening, it relays that
                 to the user through some kind of stimulus, such as the appearance of decorative 
                 arcane runes or a growing sense of power and strength.</p>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> When it awakens, the Handcannon increases the 
                 user’s Firearm proficiency by another 1, up to 6, and the user can now choose
                 which Arcane Effect occurs whenever you fire, instead of having to roll for it.</p>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> To destroy a Handcannon, it must be subjected 
                 to each and every one of the Arcane Effects from another Handcannon by the next 
                 midnight. This means that it must be shot by one or more other Handcannons at least
                 6 times, until it has suffered each of the Arcane Effects, at which point it 
                 shatters. Alternatively, striking the Handcannon with each of Excalibur’s engulfments
                 will also shatter it.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Lore.</b> The Magnum Opus, Vitriol, the White Stone; the Philosopher’s Stone 
                 goes by all of these names and many more. Considered the absolute pinnacle of 
                 alchemy, the Stone makes kings and queens of ordinary folk and turns already 
                 powerful Mattemancers into near-demigods. It is unknown when or how the Stone was
                 forged, and all attempts to replicate it have failed, but many historians and 
                 archaeologists have found material that suggests doing so requires the sacrifice of
                 living beings.</p>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> The Philosopher’s Stone bestows the 
                 following boons and curses: 2 Minor Boons, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curse, 1 Major 
                 Curse. Upon awakening, it bestows 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> One of the most well-known features of the 
                 Philosopher’s Stone is that it can permanently turn any metal into an equal volume
                 of another metal at the user’s discretion (e.g. one cubic foot of iron or lead can
                 become one cubic foot of silver, gold, steel, bronze, etc.); similarly, it can 
                 transform any precious gem into any other precious gem, such as turning a ruby into
                 a diamond, sapphire, or emerald.</p>
                <p>Upon attuning to the Stone, the user’s proficiency with Alchemy 
                 Tools immediately increases by 3, up to 6. While the Stone is in their immediate 
                 possession, they can brew any concoction without the need for non-Aether resources
                 and in half the time; likewise, enchanting items takes half as long as it normally 
                 would.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Stone has a pool of 10 Mana with which the user can cast any 
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a> spells costing <u>&#60;</u> 10
                 Mana; it restores this Mana at a rate of 1/hour. If the user is a 
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a>, they instead have 5 Mana added to
                 their maximum Mana while attuned to the Stone.</p>
                <p>The third property of the Stone is that through it, the user can 
                 transmute their own flesh to heal their wounds and extend their life, something no
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a> is able to do 
                 unaided. While in possession of the Stone, the user can use an action and expend 1
                 Mana to restore 1d10 Health to any creature they can touch; 
                 for every 1 extra Mana they spend to do this, the amount of Health they restore 
                 increases by 1d10. Additionally, the Stone slows the user’s aging process; while 
                 attuned to it, the user ages 1 year for every 10 years that pass.</p>
                <p>Fourth and lastly, the knowledge the Stone imparts increases the 
                 user’s INT score by .5, to a maximum of 6, and increases their Arcana and Nature 
                 proficiencies by 1, up to 6.</p>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Awakening the Philosopher’s Stone requires a 
                 similar process to the one that made it: to awaken the Stone, it must consume 100 
                 liters of <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a> or 
                 <a href="../Part3/Specials.html">Space Elementia</a> blood (roughly
                 20 adult Humans). The Stone consumes blood as soon as it comes into contact with it,
                 at a rate of half a liter per second.</p>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> When the Stone awakens, the Mana at its disposal
                 doubles to 20, as does its repletion rate to 2 per hour; if the user is a 
                 <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a>, their maximum Mana increases
                 by another 5. It also further increases the user’s INT score by another .5, up
                 to 6, and increases their Arcana and Nature proficiencies by another 1, up to 6.</p>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> Should the Stone be consumed by a pregnant 
                 Sentient, that child will be born a 2nd level <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Mattemancer</a>
                 and <a href="../Part3/Elementia.html">Space Elementia</a>, with an 
                 additional amount of Mana at their disposal equal to half their <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>
                 level (rounded up); additionally, this child will live 10 times as long as they 
                 otherwise would. When this child dies, the Philosopher’s Stone is destroyed. If the
                 pregnancy does not come to term, such as through an abortion, miscarriage, or 
                 stillbirth, then the Sentient who ingested the Stone will vomit it back up when the
                 fetus dies.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Titan Scale</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p><b>Lore.</b> Beings with power second only to the gods, Titans are creatures of 
                 immense power and colossal size, of which only a handful have ever existed, and even
                 fewer have been killed; to say that this is an incredibly difficult feat would be a
                 massive understatement, but it is not impossible. However, when they are killed, 
                 that then allows the slayer to take one or more of their scales as a trophy, which
                 themselves contain a fragment of the Titan’s power. Over time, a Titan’s body rots 
                 away and decays, and only two remnants of their existence remain: their skeletons,
                 which are monumental in and of themselves; and fragments of their scales, which are
                 occasionally found and dug up, granting their wielder the powers of a Titan.</p>
                <p><b>Boons and Curses.</b> A Titan Scale bestows the following boons
                 and curses: 1 Minor Boon, 1 Major Boon, 1 Minor Curses, and 1 Major Curse. Upon 
                 awakening, it bestows 1 more Minor Boon and 1 more Minor Curse.</p>
                <p><b>Properties.</b> When the user attunes to a Scale, it becomes 
                 part of their body as it embeds itself in their flesh. In so doing, it imparts
                 several of the Titan’s powers to the user, and for all of them except the STR 
                 increase and Drake fluency, the Scale has 3 charges at its disposal to use them; it
                 regains all of the expended charges at midnight.</p>
                <p>The first and second of these powers immediately increases the 
                 user’s STR score to 5 (or increases it by .5, up to 6, if the user’s STR score is 
                 already 5 or 5.5) and makes them fluent in Drake if they weren’t already.</p>
                <p>The third and more noteworthy power is the Titan’s breath weapon. 
                 There are 6 possible breath weapons: acid, fire, ice, lightning, psychic energy, and
                 poison; the obtainer of the Scale gains use of one of these (GM’s choice). At the 
                 cost of an action and 1 charge, the user can choose to exhale a stream of their
                 breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. In either case, every 
                 creature caught in the blast takes 6d6 of the appropriate damage (caustic for acid,
                 burn for fire, freeze for ice, electric for lightning, psychic for psychic energy, 
                 and poison for poison).</p>
                <p>The fourth and final power is the Titan’s flight, which manifests 
                 as a pair of magnificent wings that sprout from the user’s back at the cost of an 
                 action and 1 charge. These wings grant the user a flying speed of 45 feet for 1 hour.</p>
                <p>The last property of the Scale is not a power of the Titan’s, but
                 more its mark. When the user attunes to the Scale, in several random places on their
                 body, scales of the Titan’s color begin to grow (black, blue, green, purple, red, or
                 white), increasing the user’s Armor score by 2.</p>
                <p><b>Awakening.</b> Should the user obtain and “attune” to a second 
                 Scale from the same Titan, the Scale will awaken.</p>
                <p><b>Awakened Properties.</b> When the Scale awakens, the user’s STR
                 score becomes 6 if it wasn’t already, and the Scale gains 3 more charges with which
                 to use its powers. Additionally, each of the powers undergoes the following changes:
                 the breath weapon’s range increases to 90 feet (line)/45 feet (cone), 
                 and the damage increases to 8d8; the flight speed increases to 60 feet; the scales 
                 grow, becoming thicker and covering more of your body, increasing your Armor score 
                 by another 2; and lastly, your Intimidation proficiency increases by 1, up to 6, as
                 the might and sheer power of the Titan fills your body, mind, and soul.</p>
                <p><b>Destruction.</b> A Scale can only be destroyed by another 
                 Titan’s breath. A Scale has 50 Health (100 if awakened) separate from the user, and
                 should the user be hit by another Titan’s breath weapon, any damage they take is 
                 likewise applied to the Scale. If the Scale’s Health is reduced to 0, it shatters, 
                 and the scales that have grown on the user’s body rot and fall off.</p>
