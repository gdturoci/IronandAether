            <h2>Concoctions</h2>
            <p>Given here are all of the concoctions within I&A, along with the type
             of Aether required to brew it and the typical cost to buy it; however, it is up to your
             GM to decide how many vials of a given solution a seller has, if any, and whether or not
             it can be bought anywhere else. Unless a concoction’s description says otherwise, it 
             must be drunk or injected in its entirety for its effects to be felt. A single person
             can be under the influence of  up to 3 concoctions at once, including concoctions
             with instantaneous durations; if a 4th one is imbibed, the drinker is 
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> for the next minute, at the end of 
             which they immediately spend 2 actions throwing up and take 1d6 true damage. If a
             concoction requires two or more types of Aether, it needs at least 1 pound of each
             type to be brewed. To identify a concoction and its effects requires a successful
             DR 16 Alchemy Supplies or Arcana check, though the GM may wish to modify this DR
             based on the strength and nature of the brew.</p>
            <p>To determine the cost of a concoction, use the following steps as a guide
             (if an NPC is selling the concoction, use the prices given):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Double the cost of the Aether used to brew it;</li>
                <li>Double the cost of the other resources, or double the number of days to gather resources;</li>
                <li>Round that up to the nearest multiple of 10.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This should present a fair price for the concoction, though there may be 
             other factors that modify the price of the brew at the seller’s discussion.</p>

                        <b>Description.</b> Liquid fire is a reddish-orange liquid that, when exposed to air,
                         ignites in a flame that is much more difficult to extinguish than ordinary fire; 
                         though water will do the trick, the subject must be completely engulfed, and other
                         methods of putting the inferno out are far less effective than normal. A creature 
                         that has been ignited by <i>weak</i> Liquid Fire takes 1d6 burn damage when ignited, then
                         1d8 burn final damage at the start of each of their turns until the flame is 
                         extinguished. This damage increases the stronger the brew is by 1d6/1d8 per level of
                         strength, e.g. a <i>strong</i> Elixir of Liquid Fire deals 3d6 damage when ignited and 3d8
                         final damage at the start of each of the burning creature’s turns thereafter.<br>

            <h2>Poisons</h2>
            <p>Poisons are special in that they are the only concoctions explicitly meant to 
             harm the consumer in one way or another. To combat these effects, the victim must
             make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save, the DR for which varies
             depending on the brew’s strength. For simplicity’s sake, the Fortitude Save DR for
             each strength of poison is given here: <i>Weak</i>: 10; <i>moderate</i>: 20; 
             <i>strong</i>: 30; <i>exalted</i>: 42. The described effects assume the imbiber 
             failed the save; if they succeeded, the poison has no effect, unless they deal
             poison damage, wherein like in all other instances, this damage is reduced by the
             result of the victim's <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude</a> save.</p>

            <h2>Enchants</h2>
            <p>Enchants are powerful and usually very helpful items – unless the item in question
             is cursed, though this is rarely the case (for a list of example curses, consult “Relic
             Curses” <a href="./Chapter4.html">here</a>). An enchant’s description will say its effects, power level, the Aether 
             used to make it, and how it changes as its power level increases, if it can.</p>
            <p>All enchants must be attuned to in order for the user to gain their 
             benefits and know their capabilities. To attune to an item, the user must spend a number
             of hours equal to the enchant’s power level squared focusing on and bonding with the item
             in question during a rest; the exception to this is artifacts, which take a full day's rest to 
             become attuned to. A person can be attuned to up to 3 enchants at a time. 
             Unattuning to an enchant takes only an hour, and only one person can be attuned to an 
             enchant at a time.</p>
            <p>Because the amount of possible enchanted items is practically infinite,
             it would be impossible and impractical to attempt to list them all; instead, a few items
             will be given at each power level for each category of enchant to give an idea of what 
             each type of item at each power level is like.</p>
            <p>Determining the cost of an enchant is far easier than deciding the cost 
             of a concoction; because so much Aether is used to create them, simply doubling the cost
             of the amount of Aether used to enchant the item provides a decent base to start with, 
             and then the cost can be modified by the power level of the item at the seller’s 
             discretion. Refer to the table below as a guide on modifying an enchant’s cost by power 
             level.</p>

            <h2>Destroying an Enchant</h2>
            <p>Enchants are harder to destroy than regular items, as befits their arcane nature.
             To destroy an enchant, one has two options: the first, which will only work on enchants
             of <i>1st</i> and <i>2nd level</i>, is to simply assail the item with overwhelming force and power, 
             such as tossing it in an active volcano, smashing it repeatedly with a hammer or similar
             implement, or assault it with a variety of powerful and destructive spells. The second is
             to first disenchant the item, then destroy it as one would normally; the process for this
             is covered in the <a href="./Chapter2.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>

                         Sentient. Depending on the kind of creature, it may require an additional type of 
                         Aether besides what is listed, e.g. a Fae would require Magic, a Scorched would 
                         require Fire, etc. (all Beasts can be made with just the types of Aether given). At
                         the user’s command and using an action, the figurine transforms into a full-size 
                         living version of the creature for 1 minute, during which time it is exceptionally
                         loyal to the user and obeys its commands to the best of its ability; its stats are
                         equal to the creature’s normal stats. It can do this once every 24 hours, starting
                         when it returns back to figurine form. The transformation can end early at the 
                         user’s discretion or if the creature “dies”, though neither reduce the recharge time
                         of the figurine. When the transformation ends, the figurine reappears in the user’s
                         possession. The familiar retains all of its memories from every time it is used.<br>

                         discuss with your GM which type of Aether would be appropriate for the skill you 
                         want to increase proficiency in. As an example, Earth Aether can be used to increase
                         proficiency with either STR skill, but you could use Water Aether for the Swim 
                         skill, or Air, Gravity, or Space for Climb.<br>

                         homunculus is a flesh-and-blood creature constructed of clay and mud instead of 
                         metal and wires (though both do require Life Aether). Also like 
                         <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automata</a>, Homunculi in the form
                         of a Sentient will eventually Awaken, becoming sentient, thinking and feeling for 
                         themselves, though this takes about 5d10 years; until then it essentially functions
                         as a flesh golem with just enough intelligence and agency to carry out tasks given
                         to it by its creator. The creature, whether Sentient-shaped or not, has the same 
                         stats as its natural counterparts. Homunculi in the shape of small creatures are 
                         often referred to as familiars, especially when under the ownership of an <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a>. 
                         If a Homunculus’ owner dies, it imprints on the next Sentient it sees.<br>
                        A player-character can in fact be a Homunculus, though this will not 
                         mechanically change anything, as only Homunculi in the form of a
                         Sentient will Awaken.<br>
                        <b>Higher Levels.</b> At <i>4th level</i>, the time it takes for a Homunculus to 
                         awaken is reduced to 1d10 years. As an <i>artifact</i>, it becomes sentient immediately.

                        <b>Description.</b> A phylactery can be any container that fits within <u>&#60;</u> 1
                         cubic foot of space, and allows one to store a bit of their life essence – a piece
                         of their soul – inside it, ensuring their continued existence in the event their 
                         current body dies. A phylactery will not supply a new body for the deceased, but 
                         simply stores their soul for an indefinite time until a new unoccupied body can be
                         supplied (or the phylactery is destroyed), such as a corpse, Homunculus, or <a href="../Part3/Automata.html">Automaton</a>
                         that has yet to Awaken. An Undead being, such as a Skeleton or Zombie, does not 
                         qualify. In the event a corpse is to be used, it must have died of a cause other 
                         than old age and have no missing vital organs, such as its heart, lungs, or brain;
                         if both of these qualifications have been met, then the power of the phylactery will
                         restore the corpse to 1 Health, healing any mortal wounds. The unoccupied body must
                         be within 10 feet of the phylactery to be possessed.<br>
                        <b>Higher Levels.</b> As an <i>artifact</i>, a phylactery can create a… serviceable 
                         new body for the user. This new body forms over the course of 1d12 days, and is 
                         clearly not a normal Sentient body. In short, it has the appearance of being a 
                         half-rotted corpse, and while it will have all the necessary appendages (two arms 
                         and legs, two eyes, etc.), it will also have several chunks of flesh missing, such
                         as exposed bones and sinew, a missing nose, etc. The power of the phylactery keeps 
                         the body alive, but only for so long; over the course of 1d12 months, the new body 
                         decays beyond the point of usability. The user can choose between a body constructed
                         by the phylactery or possessing an unoccupied body.<br>
                        <b>Destroying a phylactery.</b> A phylactery does not follow the ordinary rules for
                         being destroyed. Essentially, a phylactery is the only <i>4th level</i>/<i>artifact</i>
                         enchant that can be destroyed without needing to be disenchanted, and can be 
                         destroyed as though it were a <i>1st</i>/<i>2nd level</i> object. This is because 
                         the power of the phylactery is so extremely funneled into retrieving and containing 
                         the attuned soul – and providing it with a new body – that it leaves relatively very 
                         little power to protect the container itself.
