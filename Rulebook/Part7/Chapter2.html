            <p>Alchemy is a singular term that refers to two different practices: the brewing of
             concoctions, which are (usually) Aether-borne liquids that hold special properties; and
             the enchanting of items, granting otherwise normal and mundane items arcane properties.</p>
             
            <h2>Concoctions</h2>
            <p>When Aether is distilled and mixed with other resources, such as various plants, 
             herbs, and other liquids, it becomes not only safe to drink, but the brew takes on 
             special supernatural properties. These fluids are referred to as concoctions, of which 
             there are four different types, classified according to their primary use and described
             here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Elixirs</b>, which can be thought of as the “miscellaneous” category of 
                 concoctions; their effects vary greatly and usually don’t share a common theme;</li>
                <li><b>Ethers</b>, whose primary purpose is the restoration of <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherians’</a>
                 Mana;</li>
                <li><b>Poisons</b>, which are used to kill, harm, sicken, curse, or otherwise impede or
                 damage living beings;</li>
                <li>and <b>Potions</b>, which restore Health and cure diseases & poisons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the four concoction archetypes listed above, each brew is further 
             classified by its <i>strength</i>, of which there are also four denominations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>weak</i> concoctions are the simplest and easiest to brew, and their effects 
                 are only just strong enough to be helpful;</li>
                <li><i>moderate</i> brews are a bit more complex than weak ones, and as a result are 
                 more expensive and take more time and skill to cook up;</li>
                <li><i>strong</i> mixtures do take quite a bit of resources to make, but their effects 
                 are powerful and immediately quite helpful;</li>
                <li>lastly, <i>exalted</i> solutions are incredibly strong, but require a great deal of 
                 resources and skill to make, and as such are quite rare.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When labelling concoctions, the brew’s strength is usually followed by its
             type, e.g. a <i>weak</i> Potion of Healing will be called just that. There are exceptions to 
             this rule of thumb, in which case the solution’s strength will appear in parentheses next to 
             its name.</p>
            <p>For a complete list of concoctions both common and rare included in this rulebook,
             see <a href="./Chapter3.html">here</a>. The guidelines to brew concoctions of your
             own design are given below.</p>
            
            <h2>Brewing Concoctions</h2>
            <p>Concoctions require ingredients such as special plants & herbs, Aether, and time. Given 
             here is a list of different types and strengths of concoctions, along with the necessary resources,
             pounds of Aether required, and the Alchemy Supplies DR that must be passed to do so successfully. 
             When determining the DR, subtract the pounds of Aether in your possession from the number given.</p>
            <p>For the necessary resources, you can spend the required cash to get the resources
             in a day <b>or</b> spend the required amount of time gathering the resources yourself. Neither of 
             these takes into consideration the required amount of Aether, which must be bought/found separately;
             the necessary type of Aether is given in the concoction’s description in the following chapter. If a
             concoction needs two or more types of Aether, the amount of Aether required refers to the <b>total</b>
             Aether required, not how much you need of each type.</p>
            <p>The length of time needed to brew a concoction of a given strength is given next to 
             each level of strength in the table. Failing the Alchemy Supplies DR expends the non-Aether resources,
             but not the Aether.</p>

            <h2>Enchanted Items (Enchants)</h2>
            <p>The process of infusing Aetherian powers and qualities into otherwise normal and 
             unremarkable items is known as enchanting, and it is also an alchemical process, just
             like brewing concoctions. Enchanted items – more frequently known as enchants – have 3 
             different categorizations, described here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Arcane Items</b> are otherwise ordinary items that have been enchanted with 
                 special properties, such as a hat that changes the wearer’s outfit instantly;</li>
                <li><b>Armors</b> are enchanted armors that bestow some sort of supernatural boon to
                 the wearer in addition to the normal armor bonus;</li>
                <li><b>Weapons</b> are weapons that have been enchanted so that they wield great arcane
                 powers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to their classification, enchants are also defined by their
             <i>power level</i>, which gives a general idea of their power. There are 5 power levels, 
             given here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>1st level</i> enchants are pretty weak and relatively easy to come by and create,
                 provided you know what you’re doing;</li>
                <li><i>2nd level</i> items possess respectable and noteworthy power, and require some 
                 skill to make;</li>
                <li><i>3rd level</i> enchanted items are quite powerful and subsequently quite difficult 
                 to come by, and as such are highly sought after;</li>
                <li><i>4th level</i> enchants possess wondrous power that would be coveted by any who come across
                 them, and are exceedingly rare and valuable;</li>
                <li>finally, <i>artifacts</i> are exceptionally rare, usually one-or-two-of-a-kind
                 items of great and incredible power that are in a league of their own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An item’s power level can increase given the proper amount of time, Aether, and 
             work. An enchant does not need to go through all previous power levels to reach a 
             given power level, i.e., a <i>1st level</i> enchant does not need to become <i>2nd 
             level</i> to reach <i>3rd level</i>, it can simply go straight from <i>1st</i> to
             <i>3rd</i>, or <i>4th</i>, or become an <i>artifact</i>.
            
            <h2>Enchanting Items</h2>
            <p>Enchanting items is less costly in terms of resources than brewing concoctions,
             however the cost is made up for in time and amount of skill needed to perform the 
             enchantment successfully. The exact process of enchanting an item is largely mechanically
             unimportant, though any exceptions to this rule will be specified in the item’s 
             description. Because of this, you or your GM are free to describe how you wish to perform
             the enchantment: do you hammer small bits of Aether into the item until the enchantment 
             is complete? Do you soak the item in liquid Aether for the amount of time needed? Does 
             the item need to be cooked above boiling Aether, soaking up the gas at an unnaturally slow 
             pace? The only limits are your imagination.</p>
            <p>Given here is the amount of time, Aether, and skill needed to create 
             an enchant of a given power level; the type of Aether needed varies, so discuss with 
             your GM which type(s) of Aether seem(s) appropriate for the enchant you are trying to make, 
             and refer to the examples in the following chapter. Only one check using Alchemy 
             Supplies is needed to enchant an item; if you fail this check, the amount of time you 
             spent is lost, as is the Aether – however, the process of enchanting the item has 
             already begun, and you can try again, this time requiring half the time and Aether.</p>
            <p>An <a href="../Part4/Aetherian.html">Aetherian</a> of the 
             appropriate type must also be involved in the process – not for the entire time, but they
             must be an active presence in the enchanting, as they must impart their will into the 
             Aether to aid it in bonding with the item and producing the desired effect.</p>

            <h2>Disenchanting Items</h2>
            <p>Disenchanting an item renders it completely mundane, draining its powers and 
             making it normal again. It is needed to “destroy” enchants of third level
             or higher, though at that point they are not technically enchanted anymore. It follows 
             much the same process as enchanting does, including requiring a similar amount of skill
             and materials; the only difference is that in order to disenchant an item, one requires 
             the opposing Aether as was used to enchant it. Every type of Aether has an opposing type,
             and they are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Air opposes Earth</li>
                <li>Fire opposes Water</li>
                <li>Death opposes Life</li>
                <li>Gravity opposes Magic</li>
                <li>Dark opposes Light</li>
                <li>Space opposes Time</li>
            </ul>
