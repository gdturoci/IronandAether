            <h2>Unnatural Abilities</h2>
            <p>Mutants are Sentients who have undergone specific medical, alchemical, or arcane 
             procedures – voluntarily or otherwise – that have left them with enhanced speed, 
             strength, reflexes, and a bevy of other enhanced skills and abilities. Though they gain
             much, their abilities do come at a cost: Mutants age twice as quickly as normal, and can
             never again return to how they once were. Despite this, many Mutants welcome their new
             powers, or at the very least put them to very good use.</p>

            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Mutant you gain the following class features.</p>
            <p><b>Health</b></p>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 10 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d10 (or 5) + your CON score per Mutant level after 1st</p>
            <p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b></p>
            <ul style="margin-top:0px;">
                <li>You gain 2 WP to place in any Weapon Skill(s) of your choice;</li>
                <li>You gain 1 proficiency in Alchemy Supplies, up to 5</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up and 1 WP at every even-numbered level.</p>
            
            <h2>Fearless</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, your mutated nature grants you greatly increased confidence and 
             bravery, granting you advantage on all saves against being <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Infrared Vision</h2>
            <p>The alterations to your body grant you the ability to see in the thermal spectrum,
             granting you infrared vision if you didn’t already have it.</p>
            
            <h2>Mutations</h2>
            <p>Lastly at 1st level, you gain what sets you apart from a normal Sentient: your
             Mutations, strange alterations to your body that grant you special abilities. You have 1
             Mutation at this level, and gain more as you level up, as shown in the Mutant class 
             table. Over the course of a night’s rest, you are able to change out one of your 
             Mutations for another. Over the course of a day’s rest, you can change all of your
             Mutations if you so desire.</p>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>When you reach 2nd level, the changes in your body have matured enough that they
             have started to grant you more specialized abilities. At the end of the class 
             description, under “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 7th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 13th level, you may choose either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>Lastly, at 18th level your body is barely that of a Sentient anymore,
             and you may now select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one 
             Journeyman and two Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites 
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Dodge</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, your ability to anticipate and avoid incoming danger is unsurpassed.
             From now on, when determining your Dodge score, double your AGI and DEX scores, and for
             your <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Reflex</a> score, do not divide them by 2.</p>
            
            <h2>Improved Physiology</h2>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, your abnormal body grants you advantage on saves against 
             poison and disease, as well as resistance to poison damage.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Superior Reflexes</h2>
            <p>At 5th level, your ability to save yourself from incoming harm is extraordinary.
             From now on, whenever you are exposed to a damaging effect that targets an area and/or
             does not target you specifically, such as a trap, you can double your Dodge score when
             reducing damage from that effect.</p>
            
            <h2>Tireless</h2>
            <p>Your enhanced body tires far less easily, making you resistant to fatigue damage 
             at 6th level.</p>
            
            <h2>Veins of Poison</h2>
            <p>At 9th level your blood and saliva become toxic to others. If a creature ingests
             your blood or is bitten by you, they take 2d6 + your CON score poison damage, and must
             make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude save</a> against your CON check or
             become <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">sickened</a> for the next minute. Except for 
             their next turn, they can repeat this save at the end of each of their turns to end the
             effect early.</p>
            
            <h2>Backup Mutagen</h2>
            <p>You have learned how to keep a single Mutation in reserve just in case. Starting 
             at 14th level, once between rests, you can take one minute to swap out one of your
             Mutations for another. This backup Mutation must be decided at the end of your last rest,
             and over the course of a night’s rest you can change your backup Mutation as well as one
             of your active Mutations.</p>
            
            <h2>Final Form</h2>
            <p>You are a Mutant unlike any other, more powerful and capable than nearly all of 
             your kind. At 20th level you are able to keep 2 backup Mutations instead of 1, and 
             changing from one of your active Mutations to one of your reserve ones now requires only
             2 actions instead of a full minute. Over the course of a night’s rest, you can alter 
             both of your backup Mutations in addition to one of your active ones.</p>
            
            <h1>Mutant Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">The reality of a Mutant’s very existence is that they are unnatural, they are 
             freaks who have been twisted by experimentation into something beyond any Sentient. But
             this does not have to be a bad thing: many Mutants put their enhanced physique and 
             skills to good use. The Mutant class feats help Mutants to achieve this, and make them
             more powerful than they already are.</p>

                        You can now enter your Bloodlust state 4 times between rests. Additionally, the

                         enter a state of bloodlust for the next minute. While in this state, you gain
                         resistance to physical damage and can choose to grant yourself advantage
                         on as many attacks as you wish; however, if you grant yourself advantage on <u>></u>
                         1 attack, all attacks against you also gain advantage until the start of your next 
                         turn. Lastly, at the start of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DR 10
