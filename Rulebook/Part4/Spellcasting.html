            <h2>Spells</h2>
            <p>A spell is a special arcane effect produced by the power of the caster; in the
             case of Aetherians, it is via their Aether, while for Otherworldly Arcanists, it is
             through their knowledge of the eldritch otherworldly forces that permeate the world,
             and their subsequent ability to manipulate those forces to achieve their goals.
             Additionally, there are also enchanted items that are able to recreate the effects
             of spells, such as wands and staves. Spells usually produce some sort of visible 
             and immediately noticeable effect, though there are certainly exceptions to this.</p>
            
            <h2>Perceiving a Spell Being Cast</h2>
            <p><b>Aetherian Spells.</b> All Aetherian spells require movement of some kind,
             usually some sort of somatic allegory for what the spell is trying to do, e.g. 
             when casting the spell <i>Burst</i> an Aeromancer might forcefully push their hands
             out in a mimicry of what the spell is doing, or a Chronomancer might use their 
             hands to wind back the arms of a spectral clock when casting <i>Rewind</i>. Because
             of these movements, an Aetherian cannot cast spells while wearing Medium or Heavy
             armor (except chain shirts) or Medium or larger shields. If an Aetherian wishes to
             cast a spell subtly so as not to be noticed doing so, they can make a Sleight of
             Hand check contested against the other party’s Perception check.</p>
            <p><b>OA Spells.</b> TBD.</p>
            
            <center><h1 style="font-size:1.8em;">Aetherian Spellcasting</h1></center>
            <h2>Spell Traits</h2>
            <p>Every Aetherian spell has 8 traits which detail specific and important aspects of
             the spell: <b>Mana Cost</b>, <b>Casting Time</b>, <b>Range</b>, <b>Damage</b>, 
             <b>Save</b>, <b>Duration</b>, <b>Area of Effect</b>, and <b>Notable Effects</b>.
             Aetherians can expend extra Mana to improve these traits, the rules for which are
             covered further on.
            <p><b>Mana Cost (M.C.).</b> The amount of Mana the caster must expend to unleash the
             spell’s power; the caster’s maximum Mana must be <u>></u> to the Mana Cost of a 
             spell for them to be able to cast it at all. When casting a spell, the caster must
             subtract the Mana Cost of the spell from their remaining Mana; if the Mana Cost of
             the spell is > their remaining Mana, they can still cast it, however their Mana 
             will be reduced to 0 and their current Health will be depleted by 5 times the 
             remaining difference.</p>
            <p><b>Casting Time (C.T.).</b> How long it takes for the spell to be cast. If a 
             spell has a casting time of more than 1 action, then the caster cannot take any 
             other actions while casting or the casting will fail. Until the casting is complete,
             the caster is considered to be concentrating (see <b>Duration</b> below) on the 
             spell.</p>
            <p><b>Range (Rng.).</b> How far away from the caster’s current position the origin 
             point of the spell can be placed/the target(s) can be; the caster <b>must</b> have
             line of sight on the origin point/target in order to cast the spell. If the caster
             has line of sight but cannot actually see the origin point/target, then the damage
             of the spell may be rolled with disadvantage, or if the spell requires a save, the
             target can make it with advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Damage (Dam.).</b> The type of damage (if any) a spell deals; spells always 
             deal 3 Aether Dice of damage unless otherwise stated. The caster is immune to 
             damage from their own spells.</p>
            <p><b>Save.</b> What type of save, if any, is needed; saves are always made against
             your Aether Save DR. The effects of failing the save will be given in <b>Notable 
             Effects</b>. At the cost of 2 additional Mana, the caster can give one of the 
             targets disadvantage on their save(s).</p>
            <p><b>Duration (Dur.).</b> How long the spell can last. Spells with the 
             <b>Concentration</b> tag as part of their duration require the caster’s constant
             focus, and being attacked can cause the caster to lose focus, ending the spell 
             prematurely. If a caster takes damage while casting a spell with the concentration
             tag, they must make a Willpower save against twice the final damage dealt; on a 
             failure, the spell ends. A caster can have only one concentration spell going at a
             time.</p>
            <p><b>Area of Effect (A.o.E.).</b> Detailed below.</p>
            <p><b>Notable Effects (Efcs.).</b> What will happen inside the spell’s AoE/to its 
             targets.</p>
            
            <h2>Areas of Effect</h2>
            <p>A spell’s <b>Area of Effect (AoE)</b> gives the shape of the spell, as well as 
             the dimensions of that shape. Each shape has a point of origin, or a spot from
             which the spell’s power and energy erupts. The direction into which it erupts is 
             usually up to the caster, though some spells default to the direction the caster is
             facing.</p>
            <p>The shape and dimensions of a spell’s AoE is specified in its description, and 
             the different possible shapes (and their respective points of origin) are given 
             here:
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>cone</b> has length and width and the point of origin is at the tip;</li>
                <li>A <b>cube</b> has the length of the faces and the point of origin is in the
                 middle of one face;</li>
                <li>A <b>cylinder</b> has diameter and length and the point of origin is on one
                 face;</li>
                <li>A <b>line</b> has length (and sometimes height), is assumed to be 5 feet 
                 wide, and the point of origin is at one end;</li>
                <li>And a <b>sphere</b> has diameter and the point of origin is in the exact 
                 center.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>Instead of a shape, a spell may specify a number of targets for the spell to 
             affect. In this case, the spell’s description will specify what the targets must be
             and how many of them. A creature will usually not know it has been targeted unless
             the spell produces some sort of perceivable effect, though some spells, such as an
             Animancer’s Read Thoughts, are not typically perceivable unless the spell’s 
             description says otherwise.</p>
            
            <h2>Improving Spells</h2>
            <p>Spells can be improved at the cost of additional Mana: typically, a spell’s 
             <b>Range</b>, <b>Damage</b>, <b>Duration</b>, and <b>AoE</b> are what can be 
             improved. Some spells are exceptions to the guidelines given here and will specify
             in their descriptions if that is the case.</p>
            <p><b>Range.</b> If a spell does not have a range of “Touch” or “Self”, then its 
             range can be extended by 10 feet for every 1 extra Mana spent.</p>
            <p><b>Damage.</b> A spell’s damage can be improved at the cost of 1 Mana per 
             additional Aether Die.</p>
            <p><b>Duration.</b> Improving spell duration is abnormal, and as such is given in 
             table form; all improvements cost 1 Mana. When extending a spell’s duration, the
             caster must expend the additional Mana at the time they extend the duration, e.g.
             to extend a spell that lasts 1 minute past its original 
             duration, 1 Mana must be spent at the end of the minute, automatically extending
             the spell for another 2 rounds (unless they choose to end it early).</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Base Duration</th>
                    <th>Improvement</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Instantaneous</td>
                    <td>--</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>+1 minute</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>11 - 60 minutes</td>
                    <td>+5 minutes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2 - 24 hours</td>
                    <td>+1 hour</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>> 1 day</td>
                    <td>+12 hours</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p><b>Area of Effect.</b> To extend a spell’s AoE by 5 feet in a single dimension 
             (such as making a cone 5 feet wider or a line 5 feet longer) costs 1 Mana. For 
             target spells, additional targets can be selected at the cost of 2 Mana per target
             or the Mana Cost of the spell, whichever is lower.</p>
            
            <h2>Enhanced Element</h2>
            <p>Many Aetherian spells benefit from the Enhanced Element feature that they gain at
             level 11. If a spell has the <b>EE Optional</b> tag in its description, the caster
             can make use of their Enhanced Element feature to enhance the spell’s abilities 
             (usually just altering the spell’s damage type); if a spell has the <b>EE Required</b>
             tag, the caster cannot cast the spell until they reach level 11; a spell with
             neither cannot be modified with the Enhanced Element feature at all.</p>
            
            <h2>Spell Traps</h2>
            <p>Most any spell can be set as a trap. When it is, the spell becomes a glyph, or a 
             circular collection of arcane runes, symbols, and energy that faintly glow with the
             spell’s power and which must be <u>&#60;</u> 3 feet or <u>></u> 6 inches in 
             diameter. A glyph cannot be disarmed or dispelled by any ordinary means, though 
             when set off, the energy of the glyph is expended and it disappears. If a spell set
             as a trap has a range, it targets itself, and if it has a direction for the AoE, 
             that direction is the direction the glyph is facing.</p>
            <p>There are 5 steps to setting a spell as a trap:
            <ol>
                <li>The caster casts the spell as normal;</li>
                <li>They spend an additional amount of Mana equal to half the Mana spent on the
                 spell, rounded down;</li>
                <li>They designate a surface or small object that they can touch to embed the
                 power and effects of the spell into; </li>
                <li>They spend the casting time of the spell imbuing the spell’s power into that
                 surface or object;</li>
                <li>They set the conditions for the spell trap to trigger, e.g. touching the
                 spell glyph, moving the object the glyph is placed on, opening the book the
                 glyph was placed in, etc. All spell traps have the following condition: <b>if 
                 the glyph is moved 10 feet from where it was placed, the spell goes off.</b></li>
            </ol>
            <p>To spot a glyph, a creature can make an Arcana or Perception check against what 
             the caster’s Aether Save DR was at the time they made the glyph, and to determine
             what spell the glyph contains, the creature can either be the same type of
             Aetherian as the one who set the trap or succeed on an Arcana check against what 
             the caster’s Aether Save DR was at the time they set the trap.</p>
