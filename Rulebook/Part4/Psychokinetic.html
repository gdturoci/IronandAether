            <h2>The Power of the Mind</h2>
            <p>Psychokinetics manipulate objects, energies, and even the minds of those around
             them through disciplined practice, study, and meditation. Through their own minds, they
             are able to bend and shape reality to their will, from throwing objects about the room
             to hypnotizing their enemies into fighting for them.</p>
            <p>Most Psychokinetics achieve their power through sheer study, practice,
             and force of will, usually training underneath a powerful and accomplished Psychokinetic
             looking to pass their skills on. Others are born naturals at it, finding themselves able
             to pick up toys several feet away as toddlers or sense the emotions of those around them
             before even reaching adolescence.</p>

            <h2>Class Features</h2>
            <p>As a Psychokinetic you gain the following class features.</p>
            <p><b>Health</b></p>
            <p><b>Health at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your CON score</p>
            <p><b>Health Beyond 1st Level:</b> 1d6 (or 3) + your CON score per Psychokinetic level after 1st</p>
            <p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>
            <p><b>Skills at 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 WP to place in any Weapon Skill of your choice.</p>
            <p><b>Skills Beyond 1st Level:</b> You gain 1 SP every time you level up and 1 WP at every
             even-numbered level.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Energy Manipulation</h2>
            <p>All Psychokinetics are able to exert a degree of influence over the energies in 
             their immediate environment, either increasing or decreasing the raw power of the
             forces around them. For the purposes of this feature, you gain 1 proficiency in an
             Exotic weapon henceforth referred to as “Energy”, which you can expend WP on to 
             increase your proficiency with it just as you would with any other Exotic weapon.</p>
            <p>Once per round, whenever an attack is made within 30 feet of you that 
             deals burn, electric, freeze, physical, or sonic damage, you can use your reaction
             to roll a single d6 and increase or decrease the damage dealt by that attack; the
             attack can also be made by you, in which case increasing/decreasing the damage 
             dealt is considered part of your attack and does not use your reaction. As your
             proficiency with Energy increases, the number of d6s you roll increases 
             proportionately, just like with normal weapon attacks.</p>
            <p>Because of the fine movements required, you cannot use your Energy while wearing
             any armor that grants disadvantage on DEX checks or Medium or Large shields.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-decoration:none;"><b>Psycho Save DR</b></h2>
            <p>Certain Psychokinetic features require a creature to make a save against something
             you do. This save is determined via your INT score, since your abilities are derived 
             from your understanding and knowledge of the forces in the world around you.</p>
            <p><b>Psycho Save DR</b> = your Psychokinetic level + triple your INT score 
            (rounded down)</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>Once you hit 2nd level, the power within your mind has grown enough that you have
             learned to enhance it with special abilities. At the end of the class description, under
             “Class Feats”, you may select one Novice class feat.</p>
            <p>At 6th level, you may select either one Journeyman or two Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>When you reach 11th level, you may select either one Expert, one 
             Journeyman and one Novice, or three Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>At 15th level your psychic powers are near-legendary, and you may now 
             select one Master, one Expert and one Novice, two Journeyman, one Journeyman and two 
             Novice, or four Novice class feats.</p>
            <p>If a feat has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites
             before you can take it. Feats cannot be taken more than once unless they explicitly say
             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Entropic Redirection</h2>
            <p>At 5th level, you have learned not just to increase or decrease the energies 
             around you, but also how to manipulate them for your own purposes, turning the 
             destructive powers of your enemies against them. From now on, whenever you use 
             Energy to decrease damage, you can then store and redirect that damage onto another
             creature or object within range.</p>
            <p>To do this, once you use Energy to reduce damage from an attack, record the 
             amount and type of damage that you reduce. You can then use an action to make an
             Energy attack against another creature or object that you can see within 30 feet of
             you. Any final damage that creature or object takes from this attack is equal to
             the amount and type of damage that you stored. Any energy that you have stored 
             lasts a number of minutes equal to your Energy proficiency, and at the end of that
             time the energy is lost.</p>
            <p>As an example, let’s say you store 14 points of burn damage from an 
             attack directed at you; on your next turn, you decide that you would like to inflict 
             this damage on another creature. Assuming you have 3 proficiency in Energy, you would 
             then roll 3d6, and if the result is > the target’s DEF score, the target immediately
             takes 14 points of burn damage, regardless of what the result of the Energy attack was.</p>
            <p><b>Creative Redirection.</b> Consider how you can use your Entropic 
             Redirection feature creatively, or what outside-the-box uses it might have. For example,
             if you store freeze damage, perhaps you can redirect it into water to freeze the water? 
             Or if you store electric damage and make need to jump-start an electric machine? Work
             with your DM to see what creative uses you can find for this feature.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Improved Energy Manipulation</h2>
            <p>By the time you have reached 9th level, your ability to manipulate the energies 
             in your immediate environment has greatly improved. From here on out, your Energy gains
             the following benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>Its range is extended to 60 feet;</li>
                <li>whenever you roll to increase or decrease the amount of damage dealt by an
                 attack, you can now add your INT score to the roll;</li>
                <li>you can now increase your Energy proficiency to 6.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Improved Entropic Redirection</h2>
            <p>Once you hit 14th level, you have become adept enough at redirecting the energies
             of your environment that you have learned to enhance them with your own abilities. From
             now on, your Entropic Redirection has the following benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>You can now add your INT score to Energy attacks when using Entropic Redirection;</li>
                <li>you can now add your INT  to the damage dealt by Entropic Redirection;</li>
                <li>enemies are no longer resistant to damage that you redirect if they normally would
                 be, and are instead resistant if they would normally be immune.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h2>Superior Energy and Entropy</h2>
            <p>At 20th level, your Energy gains the following benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>Its range is extended to 120 feet;</li>
                <li>its base damage die is now 1d8; ergo, if you have 3 proficiency in Energy,
                 you roll 3d8 whenever you use Energy Manipulation or Entropic Redirection.</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <h1>Psychokinetic Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Psychokinetics learn to focus their practices into a myriad of abilities, from 
             energy blades to telekinesis to telepathy. These abilities are presented here as class
             feats, which may be chosen at levels 2, 6, 11, and 15. However they choose to enhance 
             their powers, every Psychokinetic is an incredible powerhouse and an impressive force
             to be reckoned with.</p>

                         action.

                        With this feat, you can use an action to conjure a weapon of pure 
                         psychic energy. This weapon can take the shape of any weapon except 
                         Trick weapons. Damage with this weapon uses your proficiency with that
                         weapon’s type, e.g. if you summon a dagger and have 3 proficiency in 
                         Small weapons, that dagger deals 3d4 + your STR/DEX physical damage. If
                         you conjure a weapon that requires ammunition, such as a bow, you can
                         summon up to 10 pieces of ammunition, and must use an additional action
                         to summon up to 10 more; you can have up to 20 extra pieces of 
                         ammunition in this way (physical ammunition can still be used with your
                         conjured weapon). Should you summon a repeater or revolver, you summon
                         6 extra bullets and can keep up to 12 extra bullets. The weapon is
                         purple, translucent, and lasts until you dismiss it. Only you can wield
                         this weapon, and it disappears whenever you lose physical contact with
                         it (except ammunition, which disappears after it hits or misses).

                        Taking this feat allows you to manipulate the matter in your environment using
                         only your mind. Using this feature, you are able to move as many objects within 30
                         feet of you that you can see as you wish, so long as their combined weight in pounds
                         does not exceed 25 times your Psychokinetic level. You <b>cannot</b> lift living creatures
                         or sentient constructs, including yourself, nor can you use this feature while 
                         wearing armor or shields that impose disadvantage on DEX checks due to the fine 
                         movements required.<br>
                        If the object you are trying to manipulate is currently being worn
                         or carried by another creature, they must make a STR check against your INT check to
                         resist having the object pulled away from them.<br>
                        Lastly, whenever you make a STR or DEX check or perform an Action 
                         Skill that would normally require the use of your STR or DEX, you can instead choose
                         to use your INT instead as you manipulate an object telekinetically rather than 
                         manually, so long as it makes sense for you to be able to do so; for example, you
                         could make a STR or Sleight of Hand check this way, but not a Swim or Stealth check.<br>
                        When manipulating objects using your Telekinesis feature, there are
                         2 types of manipulation you can perform on an object at any one time: Fine Control 
                         and Throw, which are explained here:<br>
                        <b>Fine Control.</b> Fine control is used whenever you perform 
                         simple actions with an object you are holding using your Telekinesis feature. 
                         Out-of-combat examples include using a key on a lock, gently moving or rotating an 
                         object in such a way that does not deal damage, opening doors, etc. During combat,
                         you can exert fine control on an object as if you were wielding it as a melee 
                         weapon. Attacks are mechanically the same as normal, however instead of your STR or
                         DEX, you must now use your INT. Additionally, your INT score <a href="../Part1/Chapter1.html">grants you more attacks</a>
                         when wielding weapons telekinetically in much the same way your DEX score would when
                         wielding them normally.<br>
                        Though you can hold more than one object at a time using your 
                         Telekinesis feature, you can only exert fine control over one object at a time. You
                         cannot exert fine control over an object in any way outside of the range of this 
                         feature (30 feet at this level).<br>
                        <b>Throw.</b> Throwing an object simply means you are using an 
                         action to launch it up to a distance equivalent to the range of your Telekinesis -
                         even if it goes beyond the range of your Telekinesis - in a direction of your 
                         choosing. The damage dealt by an object that you throw is the same as the damage it
                         would normally deal (scaling with your Throwing proficiency), however instead of 
                         using your STR or DEX, you use your INT. The number of objects you can throw using 
                         a single action is the same as the number of attacks you can make using this feature.<br>
                        <b>At Higher Levels.</b> The range and weight limit of this feature
                         increases as you level up: at 6th level, they become 60 feet and 50 times your 
                         Psychokinetic level, respectively; at 11th level, they increase to 90 feet and 75 
                         times your Psychokinetic level; and at 15th level, they become 120 feet and 100 
                         times your Psychokinetic level.

                        You’ve become far more efficient in your Energy use, allowing you to make two
                         Energy attacks before running out of whatever damage you’ve stored. Additionally,
                         you can now store the damage for twice as long. If you have taken the <i>Energized
                         Weapon</i> feat, then you may now energize two different weapons, allow one weapon
                         to make two energized attacks, or give a single weapon one energized attack and keep
                         the remaining energy for yourself. If you have taken the <i>Energy Blade</i> feat, 
                         then your conjured weapon can attack using your stored energy twice if you so desire.

                         behind its actions, its emotional state, and something important to or about it.

                        <i>Prerequisite: Telekinesis</i><br>
                        You have become proficient enough at moving inanimate objects that you are now 
                         able to exert control over living creatures as well. Your ability to control living
                         creatures follows the same restrictions as controlling objects; however, whenever 
                         you attempt to control a creature using your Telekinesis, it must make a 
                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude or Willpower save</a>
                         against your Psycho Save DR. On a failed save, it is controlled by you as if it were
                         an inanimate object. If you attempt to directly harm the creature (such as tearing 
                         off limbs or crushing organs), it must make a <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Fortitude
                         or Willpower save</a> against your Psycho Save DR to resist what you are attempting
                         to do to it. It can voluntarily fail these saves if it so chooses. Damaging 
                         non-vital organs or appendages deals 2d8 true damage.

                        <i>Prerequisite: Telepathy</i><br>
                        At 15th level, you have learned to fundamentally alter a creature’s worldview 
                         using the power of your mind, and in doing so effectively enslave it. Pick one 
                         creature that you can touch; that creature must make 2 <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower saves</a>
                         against your Psycho Save DR as you use the next minute to attempt to enslave it; one
                         save at the start of the process, and one at the end. During this time, you are both
                         <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">incapacitated</a>, and if you take
                         any damage or are otherwise violently disturbed, your trance ends and they 
                         automatically succeed on their second save. If they pass either of these saves, or 
                         if your trance is interrupted during this time, nothing happens, they are aware of
                         what you tried to do, you cannot attempt to enthrall them again for another 15 days,
                         and you cannot attempt to enthrall any other creature for 24 hours.<br>
                        If they fail both of these saves, they become your thrall and are
                         considered <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">charmed</a> by you. 
                         They now follow your every order to the letter, including attacking any creatures 
                         they were previously allied with, but not including deliberately hurting or killing
                         themselves. You are always aware of your thrall’s distance and direction from you,
                         can read their every thought, and can always communicate with them telepathically,
                         all regardless of distance, so long as you are both on the same plane.<br>
                        If you or one of your close allies attacks your thrall, and once 
                         every 48 hours after becoming enthralled, they can make another <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower save</a>,
                         and on a success are no longer enthralled by you; if this happens, you are aware of it
                         immediately, as well as the former thrall’s last known distance and direction from
                         you if it was on the same plane as you when the effect ended. The effect also ends 
                         if you so choose. You can have only one thrall at a time; if you wish to gain a new
                         thrall while you already have one, you must end the effect on that one. You must 
                         take a day’s rest before attempting to create a new thrall.

                        This feat allows you to change up to 10 minutes of a creature’s memory. To do this,
                         pick a single creature within range of your Telepathy, who must then make a 
                         <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower save</a> against your

                         doing, and you can select any 10 minutes of their memory and modify it as you see 
                         fit, inserting or removing aspects at your discretion. This change is permanent 
                         unless you later choose to un-modify it, which requires the same process. This can
                         be performed once between day’s rests.
