            <h2>Class Feats</h2>
            <p>At 3rd level, you have become practiced enough in the art of combat that you have

             so. Your feat choices are permanent and cannot be changed.</p>
            
            <h2>Combat Maneuvers</h2>
            <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you’ve learned how to give your attacks special flavors.
             From the following list, you may select any 3 abilities and use them in combat, 
             following any restrictions detailed in the ability’s description. Between rests, you can
             use your chosen maneuvers a number of times equal to half your Warrior level, rounded up.
             You can use only one maneuver per attack. You can select 3 more maneuvers at 10th and 
             15th level.</p>
            <p><b>Combat Dodge.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you 
             can use your reaction to move 5 feet and double your Dodge score until the start of your
             next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Commander's Strike.</b> You can use an action to command a single 
             ally within 30 feet of you that you can see to use their reaction to make an attack 
             against an enemy of your choice, provided they have a means of attacking them without 
             moving.</p>
            <p><b>Disarming Blow.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt the
             <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Disarm</a> action as part of your attack.<br>

             until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Distancing Strike.</b> When you make an attack, 
             you can move up to half your movement as part of the same action without provoking an 
             Opportunity Attack from the creature that you damaged.</p>
            <p><b>Distracting Strike.</b> When you deal final damage with an attack, 
             for the next minute the next attack against your target from a creature other than you has advantage.</p>
            <p><b>Lunge.</b> When you make a melee attack against a creature, your 
             range extends by 5 feet for that attack.</p>
            <p><b>Menacing Blow.</b> When you make an attack, you can
             make an Intimidation check contested by the target's <a href="../Part1/Chapter6.html">Willpower
             save</a>; on a success, they are <a href="../Part6/Chapter3.html">frightened</a>
             of you until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Parry.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you can add
             your proficiency with one of your equipped weapons to your Armor score until the start
             of your next turn.</p>
            <p><b>Pinning Strike.</b> Whenever you make an attack against a creature,
             you can also attempt the <a href="../Part6/Chapter1.html">Pin</a> action
             as part of your attack.</p>
            <p><b>Quickdraw.</b> You give yourself advantage on your next initiative 
             roll for the next minute.</p>
            <p><b>Riposte.</b> When a creature targets you with an attack, you can use
             your reaction to strike back at them once.</p>
            <p><b>Shoving Attack.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt

            <p><b>Sweeping Strike.</b> When you make a melee attack, you can target 
             an additional creature with the same attack so long as the second creature is within 5

            <p><b>Trip Attack.</b> When you make an attack, you can also attempt the 
             Trip action as part of your attack.</p>
            
            <h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
             can increase one of your ability scores by 1, two of them by .5, or take a
             <a href="./ClasslessFeats.html">classless feat</a>. You cannot increase an ability
             score beyond 5 via this feature.</p>
            
            <h2>Resolve</h2>
            <p>When you reach 6th level, your fighting spirit is able to keep you going at even
             the worst of times. Once between rests, you can choose to reroll a save of any kind and
             use either result. You can do this twice between rests at 10th level, and thrice at 
             14th level.</p>
            
            <h2>Advanced Weapons Training</h2>
            <p>At 9th level, your skill with weapons surpasses nearly all of your peers. You gain
             an extra Weapon Point, and can increase a single Weapon Skill of your choice to 6. At 
             17th level, you gain this benefit again.</p>
            
            <h2>Indomitable</h2>
            <p>Finally, at 20th level, it is almost impossible to take you down. You can now use
             your Second Wind feature 6 times between rests, it no longer requires an action, and it
             restores 2d12 + your CON score Health.</p>
            
            <h1>Warrior Class Feats</h1>
            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">Every Warrior, as they train, reaches a point of proficiency at which they start
             to learn relatively unique abilities. Some channel their fighting spirit into a sort of
             rage or focus that enhances their fighting power, while others hold back and observe 
             their enemies’ weaknesses and plan accordingly, while others learn how to better wield a
             firearm. In any case, every single Warrior is a powerhouse, a force to be reckoned with,
             and a deadly and capable combatant.</p>
